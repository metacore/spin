Extensible operating systems are designed around the principle that a
system can be dynamically customized to best serve application needs.
However, realizing this goal in a safe and efficient manner poses a
number of unique problems.  In this paper, we examine the requirements
for constructing robust extensible systems and discuss implementation
techniques to satisfy those requirements with low overhead.
