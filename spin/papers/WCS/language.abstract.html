We have identified three areas where language support for operating
system extensibility is important: performance, safety, and
expressive power.  First, an extension language should support
pointer-safe casting to avoid unnecessary copying of data.  Second,
an extension language must allow a caller to isolate untrusted code.
Finally, an extension language should provide a vocabulary for
describing interfaces, modules, and procedures in a first-class
fashion.  We present specific examples of these needs, and describe
the changes to Modula-3 that we have made for our work in the \spin\ 
operating system.
