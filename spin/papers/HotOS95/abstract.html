<title>Protection is a Software Issue - abstract</title>

<h1><i> "Protection is a Software Issue"</i></h1> 
<p>
<p>
There is a misconception in much of the
operating systems community that hardware mechanisms are the only way
to ensure system integrity in the presence of malfunctioning or
malicious code. The reality is that modern operating systems are
strongly dependent on software mechanisms to protect system resources
from users.  Our position is that software protection mechanisms are
not only necessary, but have inherent advantages over hardware for
enforcing the protection requirements of an operating system. </i>
