This paper describes the motivation, architecture and performance of
SPIN, an extensible operating system. SPIN provides an extension
infrastructure together with a core set of extensible services that
allow applications to safely change the operating system's interface
and implementation. These changes can be specified with
fine-granularity, allowing applications to achieve a desired level of
performance and functionality from the system.  Extensions are
dynamically linked into the operating system kernel at application
runtime, enabling them to access system services with low overhead.  A
capability-based protection model that relies on language and
link-time mechanisms enables the system to inexpensively export
fine-grained interfaces to system services.  SPIN and its extensions
are written in Modula-3 and run on DEC Alpha workstations.
