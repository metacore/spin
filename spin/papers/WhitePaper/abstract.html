<h1><i> "SPIN - An Extensible Microkernel for Application-specific
Operating System Services" </i></h1> 
<p>
<p>

Application domains such as multimedia, databases, and parallel
computing, require operating system services with high performance and
high functionality.  Existing operating systems provide fixed
interfaces and implementations to system services and resources.  This
makes them inappropriate for applications whose resource demands and
usage patterns are poorly matched by the services provided.  
The SPIN operating system enables system services to be defined in
an application-specific fashion through an extensible
microkernel. It offers applications fine-grained control over a
machine's logical and physical resources through run-time 
  adaptation of the system to application requirements.
