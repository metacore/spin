<p>There is a complete set of user <a href="../doc/index.html">documentation</a> included with the SPIN source tree. These files were initially created for our use at the University of Washington and therefore won't be entirely applicable to you're particular situation.  For example some of the links may not work because they reference files that are specific to the UW environment; don't worry about this.  This documentation should prove valuable in your use of SPIN.</p>

<p>
Please note that some of the documents provided with the SPIN source tree are superseded by the iX86 specific documents located in <b>spin/x86_docs/</b>.
<P>
There is also a set of <a href="../papers/index.html">technical papers</a> in postscript format provided with this distribution.

<p>
If you have questions, please <a href="mailto:spin-support@cs.washington.edu">send mail</a>.
