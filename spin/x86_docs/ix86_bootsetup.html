<p>SPIN is setup to boot over a network utilizing a few different network protocols.  At the UW we have certain machines that are dedicated to booting and running SPIN.  These machines are referred to as <a href="#crash">crashboxes</a>.  The setup and configuration of all the services listed here, including the crashboxes, is described in greater detail later in this document.

<p>
It is possible to set all of this up using just two machines.  One machine serves as the crashbox and the other provides all of the other services.  This second machine can be the same Linux machine where you build your SPIN kernel.</p>

<FONT SIZE=5><P><A NAME="crash">Setting Up a Crash Box</A></FONT> </P>
<P>The device driver layer, called sal, in the iX86 version of SPIN is taken from the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> operating system. In order to load and boot your SPIN kernel, you need to have a FreeBSD file system in place. At the UW we achieve this by installing FreeBSD on the machines where we boot SPIN. In addition to FreeBSD, your machine also needs a DOS partition where we install <B><I>salboot.com</B></I>. This set up procedure explains how to partition and format your hard disk as well as install salboot.com and FreeBSD, and is intended for a machine that will predominantly be used for booting and running the SPIN kernel. </P>
<P>It is possible to use a machine on which you already have FreeBSD installed provided there is an existing DOS Partition as well. If this is the case for you, you can take a look a our FAQ: <A HREF="http://velvet.cs.washington.edu/spin/docs/ix86_faq.html#faq1">What if I already have FreeBSD?</A>. </P>
<B><a name="salboot"><U><P>Before You Begin</B></U></a> </P>
<P>You will need two boot diskettes; one for salboot.com and one for FreeBSD. You can get the FreeBSD boot diskette (boot.flp) by following their <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/install.html">installation instructions</A>. </P>
<P>Get the (1.5MB) dos.salboot boot image <A HREF="http://velvet.cs.washington.edu/spin/download/dos.salboot">here</A>. Once you have the dos.salboot image you can place it on a diskette using <B>dd</B>. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Insert a diskette into your machine.<BR>
# dd if=dos.salboot of=<I>disk device</I> bs=512k<BR>
Here <I>disk device</I> is the /dev entry for the floppy drive, probably <B><I>/dev/fd0</B></I>. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Once you have these two boot diskettes you are ready to set-up your "crashbox". </P>
<B><U><P>Create a DOS Partition</B></U> </P>
<P>At this point you should already have your two boot diskettes - dos.salboot and boot.flp. Now boot your pc with the dos.salboot diskette. </P>
<P>Create a 1MB DOS partition for salboot.com using fdisk. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A:fdisk </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Select 3 "Delete Partition or Logical DOS Drive" and delete ALL partitions. </P>
<P>Select 1 "Create Primary DOS Partition". Type "N" then "1" to create a small DOS partition (this is actually rounded up to 8MB). Return to the root menu. </P>
<P>Select 2 "Set Active Partition" then type "1" to activate partition 1. Return to the root menu. </P>
<P>Select 4 "Display Partition Information" this looks something like: </P>

<FONT SIZE=5><P><A NAME="nfs">Setting Up an NFS Server</A></FONT> </P>
<P>You will need to set up your development (Linux) machine to work as an NFS server. RedHat provides a nice <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/linux-info/ldp/HOWTO/NFS-HOWTO-3.html">guide</A> for doing this. You want to be able to mount your SPIN build directory over the network so that the SPIN kernel can be booted on a remote machine. Here is a condensed version of the necessary steps for setting up the NFS server on your development box: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Start <B>portmap</B> or <B>rpc.portmap</B>. You will find this in <B>/usr/sbin/</B>. </LI></UL>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>#/usr/sbin/portmap (/usr/sbin/rpc.portmap)</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>
</DIR>


<UL>
<LI>Edit <B>/etc/exports</B> so that you export the top level directory of where your <B>spin</B> directory is located; this is the same as MOUNT_POINT in <b>the make.conf</b> file you edited earlier. Using the earlier example of <B>/home/myspin</B>, add this line to the <B>/etc/exports</B> file: </LI></UL>

<UL>
<LI>Start <B>mountd</B> or <B>rpc.mountd</B> AND <B>nfsd</B> or <B>rpc.nfsd</B>. Look in <B>/usr/sbin/</B> to see what your versions are called. </LI></UL>

<UL>
<LI>Note that you have just manually started these processes. If you want them to run at system start-up, you will have to modify your system <I>rc</I> files. If you have questions about any of this, you might try the <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/linux-info/ldp/HOWTO/NFS-HOWTO-3.html">RedHat Guide</A> for more details. </LI></UL>

<FONT SIZE=5><P><A NAME="http">Setting Up an HTTP Server</A></FONT> </P>
<P>It is possible to fetch some or all of the SPIN extensions via http. The default configuration fetches the initial script file via http and the remaining extensions via nfs. It is <B>not necessary to have an http server</B>, so you don't have to continue with this. If you don't provide an http server, you will have to define <B>FETCH_METHOD=nfs</B> in your <B>spin/make.conf</B> file. See <A HREF="ix86_build.html#spinvars">Pre-Build Modifications</A> for more details. </P>
<P>We have used both Netscape server and Apache server at the UW. The Apache server is available free from <A HREF="ftp://www.apache.org/apache/dist/">www.apache.org/apache/dist/</A>. </P>
<P>After setting up your http server according to the instructions provided by the supplier i.e. Netscape, Apache etc, do the following. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Inside the http server's web-document root directory, create a symbolic link to your nfs mount point with the same name as your mount directory. For example, if your nfs mount directory is <B>/home</B>, do this in your http document directory: </LI></UL>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>#ln -s /home home</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>That is all there is to it. </P>
<FONT SIZE=5><P><A NAME="bootp">Bootp</A></FONT> </P>
<P>You also need to set up a <B>bootp</B> server on your development (Linux) machine. Look for <B>/usr/sbin/bootpd</B> to see that you have bootp installed. If you don't then you can get <B>bootp-2.4.3.tar.gz</B> from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.warwick.ac.uk:/pub/inet/bootp/">ftp.warwick.ac.uk:/pub/inet/bootp/</A>. </P>

<P>At the UW we use <B>rconsole</B> to create a remote connection to another machine on the network. The rconsole facility allows access to the console of a remote machine via a hardwired tty line. To set up rconsole, you need to download and and build the sources. </P>

<P>This will build the <B>rconsole</B> and <B>rconsoled</B> and place them in <B><I>/usr/local/bin</B></I>. You can read <B>rconsole.doc</B> for a more detailed explanation of the rconsole utility. </P>
<P>The build process also copies the <B>rconsoles</B> file into <B><I>/etc/</B></I>. This file specifies the remote machines and name of the rconsole server. There is a single entry in this file that can be used as an example.  If you are going to have more than one crashbox connected to your rconsole server, you will need an entry in this file similar to the following for each of the crashboxes. </P>
<PRE>
&#9ttyS0   13      loom20  2500    loom16  loom16.cs.washington.edu</PRE>
<P>Fields:

<UL>
<LI>ttyS0: Serial line corresponding to COM1 port.<BR>
This may differ on your machine.  For example if  you use COM2 in place of COM1, this would be ttyS1 </LI>
<LI>13: Baud (You shouldn't need to change this.) </LI>
<LI>loom20: Name of the machine that will be the rconsole server (Your Linux machine). </LI>
<LI>2500: Port number (You shouldn't need to change this.) </LI>
<LI>loom16: Name of the remote machine you will connect to. (Your crashbox) </LI>
<LI>The last entry is just the full name of the remote machine. </LI></UL>

<B><U><P>Connecting Your Machines</B></U> </P>
<P>You will need to connect your crashbox to the rconsole server using one of the COM ports. On our machines this required a null-modem cable with female DB9 connections at each end. I actually took a standard RS-232C cable that had female DB9 connections and added a DB9 male x female null-modem adapter to one end.  At the UW we also have multiple machines connected to a single rconsole server through a serial module.  Here is a <a href="rconsole.html">diagram</a> of the set-up</P>
<a name="runrconsole"><B><U><P>Running rconsole</U></B></a> </P>
<P>At this point you should be able to run rconsoled and connect to your crashbox. In this example I will use the machines from the <B>rconsoles</B> file above.
<P>
First execute the following command so that the rconsole prompt remains left aligned. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>#stty -icrnl &lt; /dev/ttyS0<BR>
(This assumes you are using the ttyS0 serial connection) </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now you can start the rconsole daemon and connect to your crashbox. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>#rconsoled loom16 & (Probably needs to be done as root)<BR>
#rconsole loom16<BR>
Attempting to connect to loom16 (via /dev/ttyS0) ... Connected<BR>
rconsole: Type '^_{q|e}' to exit. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hit return and you will see the prompt: </P>
<blockquote>>>></blockquote>
To exit rconsole, type <b>(Ctrl Shift Minus)</b> then <b>q</b>.
<p>
<font size=5><a name="host_map"><b>hostboot</b> and <b>hostmap</b> files</a></font>
<p>
You now need to create two files based on templates provided with your SPIN sources.
<ol>
   <li>Look in spin/user/scripts/boothost.d/  You will see two file named scsi_machine.rc and ide_machine.rc.  The names refer to the type of disk controllers on your crashmachine.  Make a copy of the appropriate file for your crashbox and re-name it "your_machine_name.rc".</li>
   <li>Now look in spin/user/scripts/bootmap.d/  You will see an example file there called 128.1.1.1.  You need to read this file and edit it based on the name of your crashmachine.  Then re-name the file with the IP address of your crashmachine.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Now you are ready to <a href="ix86_boot.html">boot</a> SPIN.</p>
