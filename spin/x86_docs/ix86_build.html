<P>This document is designed for anyone wishing to obtain, build and run the X86 version of the SPIN Operating System. The document covers setting up your build environment, getting the SPIN sources, and building SPIN. Information on other aspects of SPIN can be obtained on the web at:<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/"> http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/</a>.</P></FONT>

</P><P>
<FONT FACE="helvetica">
The first stage of this process is building the SRC Modula-3 release 3.6.  To do this you will retrieve three tar.gz files via ftp.  You will then run m3build and m3ship to build and install Modula-3.  All of this is described below.
</P><p>
Next you will install and build some auxiliary tools that are required to build SPIN.  These are available from the SPIN distribution site as a single tar.gz file.
<p>The last step outlined in this document is building SPIN itself.  This is actually the least complicated portion of the entire process.
</P><P>
At the end of this process you will have a fully built SPIN kernel.  The next step is <a href="ix86_bootsetup.html">booting</a> this kernel.
</FONT>
<FONT FACE="helvetica" SIZE=4><B><P>System Requirements</P></B></FONT>
<FONT FACE="helvetica"><P>
The x86 version of SPIN needs at least a Pentium/PentiumPro class processor.  The operating system uses features that are not available on 468 and below processors.  We have only tried running SPIN on Intel Pentium and PentiumPro processors.  Whether SPIN will work with x86 processors from other vendors is unknown.
<BR>
<a href="ix86_hardware.html">List of known working hardware</a>.
<P>The fully built spin tree takes up <b>~220MB</b> of disk space.  This is a lot of space but if you are building SPIN on more than one machine, you only need one fully built tree.  Other users can get by with a subset of the full tree.  This is described later in the description of FULLTREE in <a href="#spinvars">below</a>.

<P>
<FONT color="#ff0000">
Please note that the version of libc (glibc-2.0.x aka libc-6) that comes with the newer distributions of Linux is not compatible with the Modula-3 compiler used to build SPIN.  For this reason you need to use a version of Linux that includes libc-5.  Redhat version 4.2 is known to work.</P></FONT>

</FONT><FONT FACE="helvetica"><B><P><U>Install Linux</U></P></B>
<P>The build environment for X86-SPIN is currently Linux. This document was prepared using <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Redhat</a>'s distribution of Linux. This is not to say that other distributions won't provide the necessary environment.</P>
<P><FONT color="#ff0000">
Please note that the newer version of libc (glibc-2.0.x aka libc-6) is not compatible with the Modula-3 compiler used to build SPIN.  For this reason you need to use a pre 5.0 version of Linux that includes libc-5.  Version 4.2 is known to work.</P></FONT>
<P>The first thing to do is install Linux on your machine. Be sure to install the development tools so that your system has all the libraries and binaries for the build environment.</P>
<!--
<P>You will need the static libc files which may not be included in your installation. Look for "/usr/lib/libc.a" and "/usr/lib/libm.a". If these files are not present, you can get them from the <a href="http://velvet.cs.washington.edu/spin/download/download.html">SPIN distribution site</a>.  Retrieve <b>libc.a</b> and <b>libm.a</b> and place them both in <b>/usr/lib/</b>.

<P>The rest of these instructions for building Modula-3 are derived from those provided by Digital at <a href=" http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/modula-3/html/install-POSIX.html"><B><I>http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/modula-3/html/install-POSIX.html</B></I></a>.</P>
<OL>

<LI>Unpack all the archives:</LI>
<blockquote>&#9;# gunzip &lt; boot-LINUXELF.tar.gz | tar xf -
<br>&#9;# gunzip &lt; m3cc.tar.gz | tar xf -
<br>&#9;# gunzip &lt; m3.tar.gz | tar xf -&nbsp;</blockquote>
<LI>(Optional)<BR>Remove the tar.gz files - </LI>
<blockquote>&#9;# rm boot-LINUXELF.tar.gz
<br>&#9;# rm m3cc.tar.gz
<br>&#9;# rm m3.tar.gz</blockquote>
<LI>Move m3cc to boot-LINUXELF -</LI>
<blockquote>&#9;# mv m3cc boot-LINUXELF</blockquote>
<LI>Next you have to configure Modula-3 for Linux by editing the template file: <br><b><i>boot-LINUXELF/m3build/templates/LINUXELF</i></b>.  Here is an <a href="LINUXELF.html">example template</a> with changes already made, use this as a guide for understanding the instructions below.  Be sure you edit this file based on your particular Linux system.
<P> 
<UL>
<LI>Define INSTALL_ROOT to be the location where you want Modula-3 installed. By default it is installed in <B><I>/usr/local/</B></I>; this has worked fine for us and there is a little less work during the install if you use the default location.</LI>

<LI>Define the location of the X libraries. In older Linux distributions, these libraries were stored in the directory <b>"/usr/X11/lib/elf"</b>; in newer distributions, they are stored in <b>"/usr/X11/lib"</b> or <b>"/usr/X11R6/lib"</b>. If your libraries are stored in one of the latter directories rather than the former one, you should change all (eight) occurrences of the former name to the appropriate latter name.</LI>

<LI>Define the location of your ELF executables.  In older Linux distributions they are in the directory <b><i>/usr/i486-linuxelf/bin/</b></i>; in newer distributions, they are stored in <b><i>/usr/bin/</b></i>. Look to see where the executables <b>ar</b>, and <b>as</b> are on your machine.  If these executables are stored in the latter directory, you should change the two occurrences of the former directory name to the latter name.</LI>

<LI>Define the name of your gnu C compiler.  In older Linux distributions it was <b><i>gcc-elf</i></b>; in newer distributions, it is named <b><i>gcc</i></b>. If you have a program named <b><i>gcc</i></b> in your executable directory (namely, the directory determined in the previous step), you should change all (nine) occurrences of the former name to the latter name. </LI>

<LI>Define CC, LINK, and BOOT_CC to point to your c-compiler (either cc or gcc).  These are now set to either <b>"gcc-elf"</b> or <b>"gcc"</b>; change this to include the full path.  For example "/usr/bin/gcc-elf" or "/usr/bin/gcc".</LI>

<LI>Define MAKELIB to point to your archiver (ar).  This is now set to either <b>/usr/i486-linuxelf/bin/</b> or <b>"/usr/bin/ar"</b>, this may already be correct.  Check the location of <b>ar</b> on your machine and change the definition of MAKELIB if necessary.
<LI>Define RANLIB to point to <b>ranlib</b>, which converts libraries into more efficient random-access libraries.  This is currently defined as "touch".  If your machine has <b>ranlib</b>, change this to the full path to <b>ranlib</b> on your machine.</LI>

<LI>Define ASM to point to your assembler (as).  This is now set to either <b>/usr/i486-linuxelf/bin/</b> or <b>"/usr/bin/as"</b>.  Check to see that this is the location of <b>as</b> on your machine, and make the appropriate change if it is not.
</UL>
<LI>Wheeew...those were some confusing instructions.
</OL>
<P>Now you are ready to build.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Go to <B><I>boot-LINUXELF</B></I>, run <B><I>./m3boot</B></I>, then run <B><I>./m3ship</B></I>. The m3ship step will copy the essential pieces of the bootstrap system to the directories (BIN_INSTALL, LIB_INSTALL, ...) specified in <B><I>m3build/templates/LINUXELF</B></I>.</LI>  Note that the <b>m3ship</b> command will have to be executed as <b><i>root</i></b>.
<blockquote>&#9;# cd boot-LINUXELF
<br>&#9;# ./m3boot
<br>&#9;# ./m3ship
<br>&#9;# cd ..</blockquote>
<LI>Now you should add BIN_INSTALL to your path. For example, if you are installing Modula-3 in <B><I>/usr/local</B></I>, add <B><I>/usr/local/bin</B></I> to your path (if it's not already there). If you're running csh, this is done by adding the following line to your .cshrc file:</LI>
<blockquote>setenv PATH $PATH:/usr/local/bin </blockquote>
<P>If you change your .cshrc (or .tcshrc) file, you will need to reload it into your shell, and then run "rehash" to notify the shell of the changes to PATH.</P>
<blockquote># source ~/.cshrc
<br># rehash</blockquote>
<LI>At this point you have installed the Modula-3 compiler and driver. If everything went well and if you are pressed for space, you can now delete the bootstrap directory:</LI>
<blockquote>&#9;# cd ../<br>
            &#9;# rm -rf boot-LINUXELF</blockquote>
<LI>By default, the release is configured to build a large collection of packages. You only need to build the <B><I>m3core</B></I> and <B><I>libm3</B></I> libraries. In the file <B><I>m3/src/m3makefile</B></I>, comment out the <I>BuildChunk</I> lines associated with packages other than <b><i>m3core</i></b> and <b><i>libm3.</i></b></LI>
<P>
<LI>Go into the Modula-3 source directory and run m3build:</LI>

<blockquote>&#9;# cd m3
<br>&#9;# m3build
</blockquote>
</OL>
Congratulations, you are done building SRC Modula-3 release 3.6.
