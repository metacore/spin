<h1>SPIN Initialization</h1>

The code in the start directory runs in this order
<ul>
<li> <a href=../src/ALPHA_SPIN/SpinProgram.c> SpinProgram.c </a>
<!-- SPIN DOC EXPORT SECTION IGNORE START -->
<li> <a href=../ALPHA_SPIN/_m3main.c> ../ALPHA_SPIN/_m3main.c </a
><!-- SPIN DOC EXPORT SECTION IGNORE END -->
<li> <a href=../src/Boot.m3> Boot.m3 </a>
<li> <a href=../src/Main.m3> Main.m3 </a>
<li> <a href=../src/BootEncap.m3> BootEncap.m3 </a>
</ul>

<h3>SpinProgram</h3>

<a href=../../sal/doc/index.html> SAL </a> calls
<samp>run_program()</samp> after it initializes the hardware.
From the SAL perspective, run_program is its client and can do whatever.
<p>
The SPIN run_program routine is in <a href=../src/ALPHA_SPIN/SpinProgram.c> SpinProgram.c
</a>.  From the SPIN core perspective, the job of run_program is to
prepare for the M3 allocation and garbage collection services.
It allocates
and map memory for the traced heap, captures the stack pointer
and kicks off the Modula-3 runtime.

<h3>Modula-3 startup</h3>

Conventional M3 programs in the DEC SRC implementation have a hidden
main() C routine generated for initialization.  This routine is generated in 
<!-- SPIN DOC EXPORT SECTION IGNORE START -->
<a href=../ALPHA_SPIN/_m3main.c> 
<!-- SPIN DOC EXPORT SECTION IGNORE END -->
../ALPHA_SPIN/_m3main.c
<!-- SPIN DOC EXPORT SECTION IGNORE START -->
</a>
<!-- SPIN DOC EXPORT SECTION IGNORE END -->
.  For SPIN,
we added a new compiler option, -Mname, to use a name rather than main()
for the startup procedure.
<a href=../src/m3makefile> m3makefile</a> names this startup
procedure spin_init.  spin_init then calls RTLinker.main() to start M3.
<p>

   RTLinker initializes the runtime and calls all the mainbodies of
   the modules in the system.  The SPIN modified RTLinker first
   initializes all of the runtime and spin core services.
   Then RTLinker runs all mainbodies and these mainbodies can use
   all runtime and SPIN core services.
<p>
   The normal M3 compiler main body calling order cannot be controlled
   directly by users. It tries to evaluate a graph of dependencies and
   the resulting order changes and was often incorrect for the SPIN
   core.  Ordering the core init routines in an explicitly called
   procedure, Init(), worked around this problem. 
<p>

   RTLinker initializes the spin core services by calling
   SpinStart.Init() which is exported by Boot module.
   Boot.m3 exports SpinStart. Main's interface cannot be imported or
   exported.
<p>

   Initializing the SPIN services early allows regular main bodies
   to use SPIN services.  This allows statically linked code to use
   main bodies just as the dynamic code does.
<p>

   Main's main body is called last of all main bodies. This is not changed.
   It starts the primary scheduler, which is the final bootstrap step.


<h3>SPIN core startup</h3>

The <a href=../../spincore/doc/index.html> SPIN core services </a>
are initialized directly from Boot.m3.  The modules in spincore are
initialized by calls to module.Init functions.  The main bodies
of these modules are unused because we cannot control the order they are
called.

<p>
After the core services initialize, the main bodies can run without
restriction, which means they can fork threads, allocate memory and
use the m3 library routines.  But they <b>cannot block</b> since the
scheduler has not started.

<p>
The final initialization step is to start the global scheduler.
Since Main is the final main body run by the runtime, the scheduler
is started there.

<h3>Boot-time extensions</h3>

The SPIN core services cannot do much besides load extensions.  A
useful system requires some set of boot-time extensions.  The current
standard configure boots with extensions for user spaces, virtual
memory, devcore and the console, file system, and the shell and shell commands.

<p>
The normal source of the extension binaries, the file system or network,
do not exist at boot-time so the object files are stashed in the kernel
image at link time.  The current scheme encapsulates the object files as
big arrays in the data segment. 

<p>
Each extension also has an Encap module generated by
<a href=../src/m3makefile> m3makefile </a>.  This module has the
array variables for the encapsulated object files hard coded into it.
The Encap module passes these arrays to the Domain interface to
create, link and run its extension.

<p>
In the current implementation, the Boot module forks an extender thread
in BootEncap which will make the actual extension calls.  Since the extension
may try
to block in its initialization code (CAM does), they must be started by
the extender thread after the scheduler has started.

<p>
The Encap module main bodies run along with all the other main bodies
during M3 intialization.  The main bodies register their module with
the BootEncap module.  When the scheduler starts the extender thread, it
runs the extender routines registered by the Encap modules, running them
in the order they register.

<p>
For configuration info, see Boottime Extensions on the
<a href=../../../doc/extension_overview.html> extension page</a>.

<p>
The <a href=../../../kernel/Makefile> kernel/Makefile</a> generates
<a href=../m3statics> m3statics</a>, which describes the boot-time
extensions in quake for m3build.  
The <a href=../src/m3makefile> m3makefile </a> uses
<a href=../src/mkextender> mkextender </a> to generate an Encap module
for each extension listed in m3statics.  It also uses
<a href=../../../local/script/encap> encap </a> to generate the encap_EXTENSION.s
files in ALPHA_SPIN to encapsulate the object files for each extension.

<p>
The initialization order controlled by importing the 
extension Encap modules for extensions listed ahead of the current one.
