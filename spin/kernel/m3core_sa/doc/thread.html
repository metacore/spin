<h2> Overview </h2>
Thread.T's are OPAQUE objects. SPIN has kept much of the original Thread
interface while completely changing the underlying implementation of Threads.
I will let Gun tell you about the implementation of his Strands service.
This page will just cover the Thread interface itself.
<p>

The only changes we have made to this interface are to replace the 
floating point arguments of Pause and AlertPause with integers. Here
are the procedures declared in Thread.i3:

<h2> The Thread interface </h2>
<pre>
(* A "Thread.T" is a handle on a thread.  A "Mutex" is locked by some
   thread, or unlocked.  A "Condition" is a set of waiting threads.  A
   newly-allocated "Mutex" is unlocked; a newly-allocated "Condition"
   is empty.  It is a checked runtime error to pass the "NIL" "Mutex",
   "Condition", or "T" to any procedure in this interface. *)

TYPE Closure = OBJECT METHODS apply(): REFANY END;

PROCEDURE Fork(cl: Closure): T;
(* Return a handle on a newly-created thread executing "cl.apply()". *)

PROCEDURE Join(t: T): REFANY;
(* Wait until "t" has terminated and return its result. It is a
   checked runtime error to call this more than once for any "t". *)

PROCEDURE Wait(m: Mutex; c: Condition);
(* The calling thread must have "m" locked. Atomically unlocks "m" and
   waits on "c".  Then relocks "m" and returns. *)

PROCEDURE Acquire(m: Mutex);
(* Wait until "m" is unlocked and then lock it. *)

PROCEDURE Release(m: Mutex);
(* The calling thread must have "m" locked.  Unlocks "m". *)

PROCEDURE Broadcast(c: Condition);
(* All threads waiting on "c" become eligible to run. *)

PROCEDURE Signal(c: Condition);
(* One or more threads waiting on "c" become eligible to run. *)

(* was LONGREAL *)
PROCEDURE Pause(n: INTEGER);
(* Wait for "n" seconds to elapse. *)

(* To wait until a specified point in time in the future, say "t",
   you can use the call

| Pause(t - Time.Now())
*)

PROCEDURE Self(): T;
(* Return the handle of the calling thread. *)

EXCEPTION Alerted;
(* Used to approximate asynchronous interrupts. *)

PROCEDURE Alert(t: T);
(* Mark "t" as an alerted thread. *)

PROCEDURE TestAlert(): BOOLEAN;
(* If the calling thread has been marked alerted, return "TRUE" and
   unmark it. *)

PROCEDURE AlertWait(m: Mutex; c: Condition) RAISES {Alerted};
(* Like "Wait", but if the thread is marked alerted at the time of
   call or sometime during the wait, lock "m" and raise "Alerted". *)

PROCEDURE AlertJoin(t: T): REFANY RAISES {Alerted};
(* Like "Join", but if the thread is marked alerted at the time of
   call or sometime during the wait, raise "Alerted". *)

(* was LONGREAL *)
PROCEDURE AlertPause(n: INTEGER) RAISES {Alerted};
(* Like "Pause", but if the thread is marked alerted at the time of
   the call or sometime during the wait, raise "Alerted". *)

(* Normally "Fork" uses a default value for the size of the stack of
   the new thread.  It is possible to change the default value, and 
   also to specify the value used for a particular call to "Fork" by 
   supplying a "SizedClosure" rather than a "Closure".  Stack sizes are 
   given as a number of "Word.T"s.
*)

PROCEDURE GetDefaultStackSize(): CARDINAL;
(* Return the current default stack size for new threads. *)

PROCEDURE MinDefaultStackSize(min: CARDINAL); 
(* Change the default stack size for newly forked threads to the
   greater of "min" and the current default stack size. *)

PROCEDURE IncDefaultStackSize(inc: CARDINAL);
(* Increment the default stack size for newly forked threads by "inc".
   *)
