<h1>
Runtime support for Modula-3.
</h1>
 <P>
<HR>

<h2> Overview </h2>

The primary jobs of the Modula-3 runtime support code are conveying type 
information, linking, module initialization and garbage collection.

<h2> Type information </h2>
The interfaces which define the representation of type information at
runtime are RTType.i3, RTTypeSRC.i3 and RTTypeMap.i3.
Type information is stored for all objects on the heap. Here is the
initial comment from "RTType.i3", reflecting the original Modula-3
runtime type information:
<p>

  "RTType" provides access to the runtime type system.
<p>
  Each reference type is assigned a unique typecode.  A typecode is
  ``proper'' if it lies in the range "[0..MaxTypecode()]".  The proper
  typecodes include all those that correspond to actual types in the
  running Modula-3 program.  Other typecodes, proper and improper, may
  be used internally by the runtime system and garbage collector.
<p>
  Although the language requires that typecodes exist only for object
  types and for traced reference types (including "NULL"), the
  implementation of "RTType" also provides typecodes for untraced
  reference types.
<p>
  The values returned by the builtin operation "TYPECODE" correspond
  to (a subset of) the proper typecodes.
<p>
<h3> SPIN changes </h3>
Since SPIN can dynamically link a domain which contains novel types,
it cannot construct an array of typecells with indices [0..MaxTypecode()]
the way that SRC Modula-3 usually does. Instead, we introduce another
level of indirection. Every type of object in the program has both
a Typecode and a Typeidx. The Typecode is essentially a pointer to 
a TypeDefn object which contains all of the information known about
the type. The TypeDefn's are allocated when a new domain is linked
rather than being allocated all at once during startup. 
<p>
The Typecode
enables you to find type information when you are given an object.
The Typeidx on the other hand is used to find information about 
all of the types in the program. It is an integer between 0 and the
maximum number of types currently known and there is an array of
TypeDefn's indexed by their Typeidx. Every time a new domain is
linked, this array is expanded to include the new types.

<h2> Modula-3 Linking </h2>
By Modula-3 linking, we mean the process of collecting information about
all of the types used by the program and filling in jtables for interfaces.
These steps are performed by a call to RTLinker.Reinitialize every time a 
new domain is linked into the SPIN kernel.

<h2> Initialization </h2>

When SPIN is booting and reaches the Modula-3 initialization phase, it
calls the main body of the RTLinker module which is part of m3core_sa.
   RTLinker initializes the runtime and calls all the main bodies of
   the modules in the system.  
<p>
   The major steps of Modula-3 initialization are:
<ul>
<li> Placing exported procedures into the right jtable spots.
<li> Installing signal handlers.
<li> Initializing the garbage collector.
<li> Initializing exception handling.
<li> Starting the services in spincore.
<li> Running the main bodies of the statically linked domains.
</ul>

The important interfaces for initialization are RTLinker.i3 and RT0.i3.

<h2> Garbage collection </h2>

The text of the comment from RTCollector.i3 follows.
<p>
"RTCollector" provides control over the Modula-3 garbage collector.
<p>
 The purpose of a garbage collector is to reclaim unreachable
   nodes on the traced heap; most Modula-3 programs could not run
   very long without a collector.  Even so, automatic garbage
   collection has some practical drawbacks.

   <ol>
   <li>

      The collector might move heap nodes to different addresses.  This is
      usually unnoticable to programs, but can cause problems when programs
      must work with the addresses of heap nodes, since it is not
      guaranteed that "ADR(x^)" is a constant over the lifetime of
      "x^".  There are two main cases when programs must work with
      such addresses.

      <ol>
      <li>

         To implement hash tables, etc.

      <li>

         To pass addresses to procedures written in other languages,
         which is inherently unportable.

      </ol>
   <p>
   <li>

      Unsafe code can put the traced heap temporarily into an
      inconsistent state.  If the collector happens to run then, it
      might delete nodes that seem unreachable but that in fact are
      accessible.  Of course, unsafe code itself is inherently unportable.

   </ol>

   This interface allows the program to control the Modula-3 collector
   to avoid such problems, as well as to pass hints to improve
   performance.

<p>
<h3> Disabling the collector. </h3>

   The collector is initially enabled; the collector can reclaim
   storage, and move nodes in memory.  While the collector is
   disabled, there will be no time spent in the collector.  Allocation
   in the traced heap may proceed normally, although the heap will
   grow without bound.  Nodes unreachable by the Modula-3 rules will
   not be reclaimed, and no nodes will move.

<p>
<h3>Disabling motion. </h3>

   Disabling motion gives fewer guarantees than disabling the
   collector; while motion is disabled, it is guaranteed only that no
   nodes will move.  Disabling motion is no more expensive than
   disabling the entire collector, and may be cheaper in some
   implementations.

<p>
<h3>Collecting. </h3>

   Calling "Collect" is a hint from the program that now would be a
   good time for a collection (for example, if a large amount of
   storage has become unreachable, or if the program expects to wait
   some time for an external event).

<p>
<h3>Implementation notes.</h3>

   This section describes the implementation of the SRC Modula-3
   collector, as a guide to SRC Modula-3 programmers and as an
   indication of how this interface is matched to a particular
   implementation.  Portable programs must not take advantage of
   implementation details of the SRC Modula-3 collector.
<p>
   The SRC Modula-3 collector is an incremental, generational,
   conservative mostly-copying collector that uses VM protection on
   heap pages to be notified of certain heap accesses.
<p>
   Because the SRC collector is conservative, an inaccessible node may
   be considered reachable if a bit-pattern either on a thread's stack
   or in its registers might be a reference to or into the node.
   Experience to date has not shown accidental node retention to be a
   problem.
<p>
   The SRC collector will not collect or move a node while any
   thread's stack or registers contains a reference to or into the
   node.  The SRC Modula-3 system guarantees that this will include
   references passed as value parameters.  This guarantee is useful
   for calling foreign procedures.
<p>
   "Disable" completes the current incremental collection, if any, and
   unprotects all heap pages, so that no page faults will occur while
   collection is disabled.  No new collections will start while
   collection is disabled.  The next collection after collection is
   reenabled will be total, as opposed to partial, since unprotecting
   the heap loses generational information.
<p>
   "DisableMotion" disables further collections from beginning.
   "DisableMotion" does not finish the current incremental collection,
   since the collector already guarantees that the program will not
   see addresses in the previous space.  No new collections will start
   while motion is disabled, so that the current space will not become
   the previous space.  It is not necessary to unprotect the heap.
<p>
   "Collect" completes the current incremental collection, if any, then
   performs a total collection before returning to the caller.
<p>
   The SRC collector also supports additional operations for
   controlling the frequency of collection, disabling and reenabling
   incremental and generational collection, reporting on collector
   performance, and so on.  These operations are accessible through the
   implementation-dependent "RTCollectorSRC" interface.


<h2>Runtime Hooks</h2>

The file src/runtime/common/RTHooks.i3 describes the runtime hooks
that the compiler-generated code accesses.  This file cannot be
changed without a synchronized change to Runtime.i3 and Runtime.m3 in
the compiler sources.  Also, it should probably be kept in sync with
the RTHooks.i3 file in the local libraries.  For some reason the
compiler looks there for the information on hooks at compile-time.
