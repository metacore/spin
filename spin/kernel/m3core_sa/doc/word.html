<h2>
Overview
</h2>
Completing our tour of the standard Modula-3 interfaces, we come to the
Word interface. It has some significant differences from the others.
First, the interface is hard-wired into the compiler so that the
simpler Word operations can be performed inline instead of through 
function calls. Second, many procedures here are declared EPHEMERAL
which is a SPIN invention meaning that they can be interrupted at any
time without serious ill-effects.

<h2> Using the Word interface </h2>
It is worth remembering that declaring a variable to be of type Word.T
does not force the compiler to perform unsigned operations on it. If
you want the unsigned operations, you must use the following procedures
explicitly.

<pre>
(* A Word.T w represents a sequence of Word.Size bits
          w(0), ..., w(Word.Size-1).
   It also represents the unsigned number
          sum of 2^(i) * w(i) for i in 0, ..., Word.Size-1. *)

TYPE
  T = INTEGER;
      (* encoding is implementation-dependent; e.g., 2's complement. *)

CONST
  Size : INTEGER = BITSIZE (T);                (* implementation-dependent *)

EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE Plus (x, y: T): T;         (* (x + y) MOD 2^[Word.Size] *)
EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE Times (x, y: T): T;        (* (x * y) MOD 2^[Word.Size] *)
EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE Minus (x, y: T): T;        (* (x - y) MOD 2^[Word.Size] *)
EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE Divide (x, y: T): T;       (* x divided by y *)
EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE Mod (x, y: T): T;          (* x MOD y *)
EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE LT (x, y: T): BOOLEAN;     (* x < y *)
EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE LE (x, y: T): BOOLEAN;     (* x <= y *)
EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE GT (x, y: T): BOOLEAN;     (* x > y *)
EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE GE (x, y: T): BOOLEAN;     (* x >= y *)
EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE And (x, y: T): T;          (* Bitwise AND of x and y *)
EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE Or (x, y: T): T;           (* Bitwise OR of x and y *)
EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE Xor (x, y: T): T;          (* Bitwise XOR of x and y *)
EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE Not (x: T): T;             (* Bitwise complement of x *)

EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE Shift (x: T; n: INTEGER): T;
(* For all i such that both i and i - n are in the range [0 .. Word.Size - 1],
   bit i of the result equals bit i - n of x. The other bits of the result are
   0. Thus, shifting by n > 0 is like multiplying by 2^(n) *)

EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE LeftShift (x: T; n: [0..Size-1]): T;
(* = Shift (x, n) *)

EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE RightShift (x: T; n: [0..Size-1]): T;
(* = Shift (x, -n) *)

EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE Rotate (x: T; n: INTEGER): T;
(* Bit i of the result equals bit (i - n) MOD Word.Size of x. *)

EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE LeftRotate (x: T; n: [0..Size-1]): T;
(* = Rotate (x, n) *)

EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE RightRotate (x: T; n: [0..Size-1]): T;
(* = Rotate (x, -n) *)
 
EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE Extract (x: T; i, n: CARDINAL): T;
(* Take n bits from x, with bit i as the least significant bit, and return them
   as the least significant n bits of a word whose other bits are 0. A checked
   runtime error if n + i > Word.Size. *)

EPHEMERAL PROCEDURE Insert (x, y: T; i, n: CARDINAL): T;
(* Return x with n bits replaced, with bit i as the least significant bit, by
   the least significant n bits of y. The other bits of x are unchanged. A
   checked runtime error if n + i > Word.Size. *)
