<h1>Strands</br></h1>
<p>
Strands are like threads, only simpler.

<dl>
<h2>Status</h2>
There is a pointer in v0 to the current version of kernel strands,
global scheduler, synchronization primitives and the supported event 
names.

<p>
Stuff being implemented as you read this.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

This is a list of write-ups on strands. It includes papers, notes, as
well as excerpts from e-mail discussions. It documents the evolution
of the notion and proposed interfaces. Even though the interfaces
presented in early papers are mostly obsolete they offer a good
introduction and rationale for most of the design decisions. For the
"state of the art" strand interface start reading from the end of the
list.
