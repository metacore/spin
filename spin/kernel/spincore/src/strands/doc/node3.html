<P>
A strands package should handle the following set of events.
The examples section describes some mundane uses of these events to
implement functionality commonly found in today's schedulers.
<P>
All the events described below appear in the interface definition for
the module Strand and should be prefixed with ``<tt> Strand.</tt>''.
The strand parameters are REFANY's because the precise definition of
a strand is not relevant to the system. The handlers with sufficient
interest can attempt a narrow operation at run time.
<P>
The events described below are raised by various system entities to
signal changes in crucial system state and to request some sort of a
response from involved parties. Thus, the failure mode describes what
happens when an involved party (e.g. a strand scheduler tending a
particular strand) fails to take appropriate steps to cope with the
change in system state (e.g. reschedules the strand even though it
is currently not runnable). There is no detection of failure, since
such detection is in general impossible; however, the Strand interface
has been designed such that failures only affect the parties that
trust the failed module. The failure mode for each event is described
in detail below.
<P>
All events in the strand interface are bounded.
