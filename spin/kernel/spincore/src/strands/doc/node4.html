<DL ><DT><tt> PROCEDURE Stop(strand: REFANY; a: PROCANY := NULL) : INTEGER;</tt>
<DD> 
<P>
The raising of this event is an indication that all volatile state
pertaining to the named strand should be saved, and that the strand 
be set up to execute the named continuation upon a subsequent <tt> Run</tt>.
A NULL continuation indicates that the strand should resume from where
it left off. The continuation is NULL by default.
The strand remains runnable after a stop event and may be rescheduled 
at a later time with the <tt> Run</tt> event.
A typical strands package would save away all state in a region
identified by the strand argument.
Failure to comply results in the loss of the state of computation of
the strand in question.
<P>
Examples: A scheduler would raise this event at every time quanta
expiration, to preempt the currently running strand.
A strand might checkpoint itself to implement RAS.
<P>
<DT><tt> PROCEDURE Run(strand: REFANY);</tt>
<DD> 
<P>
The raising of this event indicates that the named strand owns the CPU
resources.
A typical strands package would resume the computation of the named
strand from where it left off at this stage.
Failure to comply results in the execution of the idle loop until the
next <tt> Stop</tt> event.
<P>
Examples: A scheduler would raise this event on the next strand to be
executed at a context switch. A strand might unilaterally handoff
control to another through this mechanism.
