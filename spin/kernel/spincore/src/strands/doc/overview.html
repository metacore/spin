<H2>Overview</H2>

This is a list of write-ups on strands. It includes papers, notes, as
well as excerpts from e-mail discussions. It documents the evolution
of the notion and proposed interfaces. Even though the interfaces
presented in early papers are mostly obsolete they offer a good
introduction and rationale for most of the design decisions. For the
"state of the art" strand interface start reading from the end of the
list.

There are several interfaces having to do with strands.
They are described here.
