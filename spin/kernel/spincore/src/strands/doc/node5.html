<P>
<DL ><DT><tt> PROCEDURE Block(strand: REFANY);</tt>
<DD> 
<P>
This event indicates that the named strand is not eligible for
execution and should no longer be scheduled. A blocked thread should
not be <tt> Run</tt> by the scheduler until an <tt> Unblock</tt> occurs.
A typical response from a scheduler module would be to save away current
state (with <tt> Stop</tt>), make an indication that the current thread is
no longer runnable and pick a new one to run.

<P>
Failure to comply might possibly result in garbled execution, or lack
of forward progress by the named strand.
<P>
Examples: VM or synchronization subsystems would raise this event to
suspend the execution of a process.
<P>
<DT><tt> PROCEDURE Unblock(strand: REFANY);</tt>
<DD> 
<P>
This event indicates that the named strand is eligible for execution
and should be scheduled.
Failure to comply results in denial of service to the named strand.
<P>
Examples: The VM interface, for instance, would use this event to
unblock a spindle that is blocked waiting on some paging activity.
<P>
<DT><tt> PROCEDURE Yield();</tt>
<DD> 
<P>
This event indicates that the currently running entity has relinquished
the processor. A typical scheduler would pick a new runnable strand and
raise <tt> Run</tt> on it.
<P>
<DT><tt> PROCEDURE Current() : REFANY;</tt>
<DD> 
<P>
This event returns the identity of the currently running strand. The
identity is a piece of software state that is updated through the
context switches.
