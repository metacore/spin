<P>
The user-level strand model is that the units of execution are managed
by two separate entities: a strands package that defines what exactly a
unit of execution is, and a strands scheduler that decides when the
execution should occur. It is possible that the same module implements
both functions, but this clean separation exists to allow incremental
changes to either functionality.
<P>
User level schedulers are simply a collection of spindles that respond to
the <tt> Block</tt> and <tt> Unblock</tt> events, and raise the <tt> Stop</tt> and
<tt> Run</tt> events described above. A user-level scheduler is
responsible for setting up the appropriate event handlers for these
events with when clauses that match the set of strands it is managing.
<P>
Obviously, they are free to export more interfaces than those
described. In particular, they will most likely want to export an
interface by which clients can register new strands to be scheduled
with a particular scheduler. They may also support more exotic
features such as lotteries, etc. but no other SPIN subsystem will rely
on the existence of such interfaces.
<P>
A preemptive user-level scheduler will make use of the
<tt> Clocktick </tt> event, which is raised by spin core at appropriate
intervals and has the same signature as the <tt> trap</tt> event, namely
<tt> Clocktick(ss: saved_state.T, cause: Causes.T)</tt>.
<P>
A user level strands package responds to the <tt> Stop</tt> and <tt> Run</tt>
events raised by various schedulers on the strands it is managing, and
in turn raises <tt> Block</tt> and <tt> Unblock</tt> events to communicate
with the schedulers.
<P>
Appendix A shows some example code from a user-level strands package
and a synchronization module.
