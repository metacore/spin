A shrink wrapped SPIN system has the following components:
<UL><LI> a trusted core that provides interfaces that manipulate bare hardware.
<LI> a trusted event dispatcher.
<LI> a trusted global scheduler that makes global CPU resource usage
      decisions.
<LI> a trusted kernel-strand scheduler that is responsible for executing
      spindles that the dispatcher has identified as runnable.
<LI> subsystems for memory management, IPC, networking, etc.
<LI> possibly servers that use these subsystems to support a
      cohesive API (e.g. Unix). 
</UL>
<P>
All user level threads are strands that are scheduled by some strand
scheduler. Further, there exists a kernel strand scheduler which runs
the spindles marked by the dispatcher as ready to run. Hence,
executing spindles conform to the strand interface and are scheduled
just like every other executable entity in the system. That is, there
is no inherent dichotomy between user-level strands and spindles
except for the level of trust granted to them. This is intented to
facilitate the migration of code from user-level into kernel space.
