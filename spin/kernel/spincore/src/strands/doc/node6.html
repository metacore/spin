<P>
Kernel strands are minimal threads that run in the kernel address
space and are used to execute the spindles that are to be fired in
response to an event. They are efficiently created and destroyed by
the kernel strand package and scheduler.
<P>
Efficient creation in this context means that the absolute
minimum amount of work is performed to get a spindle executed. For
instance, the kernel strand package can reuse the stack of a blocked
user-level thread and can execute successive handlers without saving
any state (unless they block, in which case minimum state to unblock
and restart is saved). Thus, even interrupt handlers run as threads
and use the same synchronization primitives as regular extension code.
<P>
The kernel strand scheduler receives the set of spindles to execute
from the event dispatcher. Although the kernel strand scheduler conforms to
the spindle event interface, it does not go through the event dispatcher
(since the kernel strand scheduler is involved in event handling, going
through the dispatcher would cause infinite regress). The attributes
of the spindles to execute (e.g. their scheduling priority with
respect to other strands) is registered with the
kernel strand scheduler by the event dispatcher at the time the
spindles are installed (and may be changed at any later time).
