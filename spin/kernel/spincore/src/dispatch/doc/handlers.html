<h2> Overview </h2>

Several operations on sets of bindings are provided for more
sophisticated changes to the state of events.  The provide the
abitilty to query the set of handlers installed on an event, to
atomically swap sets of handlers, obtain the identity of the <a
href="model.html"> original handler</a>.

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
PROCEDURE SwapHandlers (deactivationList : REF ARRAY OF Binding;
	                activationList   : REF ARRAY OF Binding)
                       RAISES { Error };

PROCEDURE GetHandlers (event: PROCANY;
                       module   : RTCode.Module): REF ARRAY OF Binding
                      RAISES { Error };

PROCEDURE IsInstalled (binding: Binding): BOOLEAN;

PROCEDURE GetOriginalHandler (event: PROCANY): Binding
                              RAISES { Error };

</pre>

<h2> Usage </h2>

<i>SwapHandlers</i> procedure allows changing the state of a number of
bindings in one atomic operations.  It takes two lists of bindings,
each of them can be for a different event.  The first list contains
the bindings that should be uninstalled from their events, the second
list contains the bindings that should be installed.  If an inactive
binding is only on an uninstallation list, than the operation is a
noop for this binding.  If an active binding is on the installation
list than it will be reinstalled with the new options.  If the same
binding is on the intallation and uninstallation list, it is treated
as if it was only on the installation list.  All of the changes are
done atomically with respect to invocations.

<p>

<i>GetHandlers</i> allows returns a list of bindings installed on a
particular event.  

<p>

<i>GetOriginalHandler</i> returns the original handler of an event,
i.e., the procedure implementing it.  The identity of the original
handler is necessary of the original handler's properties should be
changed, for example, to become the <a href="model.html"> default
handler</a> or to be uninstalled.

<p>

<i> IsInstalled</i> allows checking whether a binding is active or not.

<h2> Example </h2>

Consider a service <i>S</i> that uses three events: <i>A.E</i>,
<i>B.E</i>, <i>C.E</i>.  If this service is being replaced by its new
version <i>S1</i> then <i>S</i>'s handlers should be atomically
replaced with handler's provided by <i>S1</i> (in some cases this
would also require some state transfer from <i>S</i> to <i>S1</i> but
that's specific to the service and not provided by the dispatcher).
In this example, <i>S1</i> calls <i>S</i> to get its list of handlers
and then replaces it with its own handlers (<i>Service</i> is a known
type of the service provided by <i>S</i> and <i>S1</i>,
<i>"ServiceName</i> is a know name of that service):

<pre>
MODULE S1;

PROCEDURE A (...) = BEGIN ... END A;
PROCEDURE B (...) = BEGIN ... END B;
PROCEDURE C (...) = BEGIN ... END C;

VAR
  oldVersion  : Service;
  oldHandlers : REF ARRAY OF Dispatcher.Binding;
  newHandlers : REF ARRAY OF Dispatcher.Binding;

BEGIN
  (* get the old handlers *)
  oldVersion := NameServer.Get("ServiceName");
  oldHandlers := oldVersion.GetHandlers();

  (* create new handlers *)
  newHandlers := NEW(REF ARRAY OF Dispatcher.Binding, 3);
  newHandlers[0] := Dispatcher.Create(A.E, NIL, A);
  newHandlers[1] := Dispatcher.Create(B.E, NIL, B);
  newHandlers[2] := Dispatcher.Create(C.E, NIL, C);

  (* swap them atomically *)
  Dispatcher.SwapHandlers(oldHandlers, newHandlers);  
END S1;
