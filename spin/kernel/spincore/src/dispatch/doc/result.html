<h2> Overview </h2>

If an event returns a result then some mechanism must be used to
determine what the final result of the invocation is in case more than
one handler is invoked.  In <i>SPIN</i>, the result handling protocol
is specified as a procedure (called <b> result handler </b>) installed
to process handlers' results.  Results from all the handlers are
passed to that procedure one by one as each of the invoked handlers
return, and the procedure returns the final result of the
invocation.  If no result handler is installed then the result from
the last invoked handler is returned as the final result of event
invocation.

<p>

The dispatcher raises an exception in case no handler is invoked in
response of raising an event that should return a result.  Otherwise
an unspecified result would be returned violating typesafety of
invocation.  To avoid the exception, and return a meaningful result in
this case, a handler (called <b> default handler </b>) can be
installed to run in case no other handler is called.

<p>

Because all the callers and handlers depend on result handler and the
default handler, they can be changed only by the primary implementation
module for that event.

<p>

The default state of result handling is no result handler and no
default handler.

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
PROCEDURE InstallResultHandler (event   : PROCANY;
                                handler : PROCANY;
                                module  : RTCode.Module;
                                closure : REFANY := NIL) 
                               RAISES { Error };

PROCEDURE InstallDefaultHandler (event   : PROCANY;
                                 handler : PROCANY;
                                 module  : RTCode.Module;
                                 closure : REFANY := NIL) 
                                RAISES { Error };
</pre>

<h2> Typing rules </h2>

The dispatcher dynamically checks the types of result and default
handlers at the time of their installation according to the following
rules:

<ul>
<li> Procedure types:
<ul>
<li> default handler and result handler must be procedures (be of type
	PROCANY) and must be legal.
</ul>
<li> Taking closure:
<ul>
<li> a handler must take a closure is the closure argument is not
	<i>NIL</i>, 
<li> a handler can take a closure if the closure argument is
	<i>NIL</i>, 
</ul>
<li> No closure:
<ul>
<li> a default handler that does not take a closure must have the same type as
	the event, 
<li> a result handler that does not take a closure must take two
	arguments of the same type as the result of the event and
	return a result of the same type as the result of the event.
</ul>
<li> With closure:
<ul>
<li> if a default or result handler takes a closure than it must have an
	additional argument (first, before all other arguments) of the
	type which is a subtype of <i>REFANY</i>,
</ul>
<li> Closure:
<ul>
<li> a closure argument must be a subtype of the type of the first
	argument of the corresponding procedure argument.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2> Usage </h2>

A result handler is installed using the <i>InstallResultHandler</i>
procedure in the <i>Dispatcher</i> interface and the default handler
is installed using the <i>InstallDefaultHandler</i> procedure in that
interface.  Their arguments are the event for which the handler is
being installed, the handler, and the identification of a primary
implementation module for that event.  Optionally, a closure may be
added for the handler.  Both procedures raise an exception if the
module argument is not the primary implementation module for the
event, if the types of the event, the handler, and the closure do not
match, or if either the event or the handler is not a legal procedure.

<p>

If <i>NIL</i> is passed as either of the handlers then the default
state of result handling is reinstated.

<h2> Example </h2>

Consider an event that returns a <i>BOOLEAN</i> result.  The module
that implements the event installs the procedure <i>HandleResult</i>
as a result handler to ensure that the final result of the event
invocation or a logical <i>OR</i> and <i>DefaultResult</i> as the
default handler to ensure that <i>FALSE</i> is returned if no handler
is invoked as result or event raise.

<pre>
MODULE Example;

PROCEDURE Event(...): BOOLEAN =
  BEGIN
    ...
  END Event;

PROCEDURE HandleResult(result: BOOLEAN; prevResult: BOOLEAN): BOOLEAN =
  BEGIN
    RETURN result OR prevResult;
  END HandleResult;

PROCEDURE DefaultResult(...): BOOLEAN =
  BEGIN
    RETURN FALSE;
  END DefaultResult;

BEGIN
  Dispatcher.InstallResultHandler(Event, HandleResult, THIS_MODULE());
  Dispatcher.InstallDefaultHandler(Event, DefaultResult, THIS_MODULE());
END Example.
