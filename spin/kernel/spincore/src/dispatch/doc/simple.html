<h2> Overview </h2>

This part of the dispatcher interface allows manipulation of a single
binding: its creation, activation and deactivation. 

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>

PROCEDURE Create(event: PROCANY;
                 guard: PROCANY;
                 handler: PROCANY;
                 guardClosure: REFANY := NIL;
                 handlerClosure: REFANY := NIL;
                 options: Options := DefaultOptions;
                 key : Auth.Key := NIL
                ): Binding
                RAISES { Error };

PROCEDURE Install (binding: Binding) 
                  RAISES { Error };

PROCEDURE Uninstall (binding: Binding) 
                    RAISES { Error };

PROCEDURE InstallHandler(event: PROCANY;
	                 guard: PROCANY;
        	         handler: PROCANY;
                	 guardClosure: REFANY := NIL;
	                 handlerClosure: REFANY := NIL;
        	         options: Options := DefaultOptions;
			 key: Auth.Key := NIL
	                ): Binding
        	        RAISES { Error };
</pre>

<h2> Usage </h2>

<i>Create</i> is used to create an inactive binding.  A binding
descriptor returned as the result of this procedure can be
subsequently used to install and uninstall the binding as well as
change properties of the binding.

<p>

The required parameters of binding creation are: the event on which
the handler will be installed, the handler procedure and the guard
procedure.  Neither event nor handler procedure can be <i>NIL</i>.  If the
guard procedure is <i>NIL</i> then the handler will be invoked
unconditionally (each time the event is raised).  Optional parameters
include closures and installation options.  A closure can be specified
for either a guard or a handler.  If a handler or a guard procedure
takes a closure then it is passed to it then the closure will be
passed to the procedure as the first argument.

<p>

<i>Install</i> is used to activate a single binding. <i>Uninstall</i>
is used to deactivate a single binding.  These two procedures
guarantee atomicity of installation and uninstallation with respect to
on-going event invocations. (In other words, handlers can be installed
and uninstalled on the fly.)  They do not provide any atomicity
across a single call, for example, if two handlers are swapped on an
event by uninstalling one through a call to <i>Uninstall</i> and
installing another through a call to <i>Install</i> there is a period
of time between the two calls during which none of them is installed.
Use the <a href="handlers.html"><i>ChangeHandlers</i></a> procedure
where such atomicity is required.  

<p>

<i> InstallHandler </i> creates an active binding.  It takes the same
arguments as <i>Create</i> and in fact it is equivalent to:
<pre>
	VAR binding : Binding := Create(...);
	Install(binding);
	RETURN binding;
</pre>

Since this is the most common case of handler installation a separate
procedure is exported by the dispatcher.  

<p>

Explicit pair of calls to <i>Create</i> and <i>Install</i> should be used
instead of <i>InstallHandler</i> either if the installation has to be
synchronized with other event operations (see <a
href="handlers.html"><i>ChangeHandlers</i></a>) or to speed up
initialization be removing creation, which includes typechecking and
authorization, out of a critical path.

<h2> Typing rules </h2>

The dispatcher dynamically checks the types of procedures at the time
a binding is created according to the following rules:

<ul>
<li> Procedure types:
<ul>
<li> event, guard, and handler must be procedures (be of type PROCANY),
<li> event, guard, and handler must be legal
	procedures.
</ul>
<li> Taking closure:
<ul>
<li> a handler or a guard must take a closure is the corresponding
	closure argument (guardClosure for guard and handlerClosure
	for handler) is not <i>NIL</i>,
<li> a handler or a guard can take a closure if the corresponding
	closure argument is <i>NIL</i>,
</ul>
<li> No closure:
<ul>
<li> a handler that does not take a closure must have the same type as
	the event,
<li> a guard that does not take a closure must have the same number
	and types of arguments as the event but must return result of
	type <i> BOOLEAN</i>,
</ul>
<li> With closure:
<ul>
<li> if a handler or a guard takes a closure than it must have an
	additional argument (first, before all event arguments) of the
	type which is a subtype of <i>REFANY</i>,
</ul>
<li> Closure:
<ul>
<li> a closure argument must be a subtype of the type of the first
	argument of the corresponding procedure argument.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2> Examples </h2>

Installation of a simple handler which is always executed:

<pre>
MODULE Counter;
        
VAR 
  binding : Dispatcher.Binding;
  counter : INTEGER;

PROCEDURE Counter(...) =
  BEGIN
    INC(counter);
  END Counter;

PROCEDURE Start () =
  BEGIN
    counter := 0;
    binding := Dispatcher.InstallHandler(IP.PacketRecv, Count, NIL);
  END Start;

PROCEDURE Stop (): INTEGER =
  BEGIN
    Dispatcher.Uninstall(binding);
    RETURN counter;
  END Stop;

BEGIN
END Counter;
</pre>

Note that:
<ul>
<li> the argument to uninstallation is the value returned form
	installation,
<li> the counter used by the handler is initialized before the
	installation because there are no synchronization between the
	installation and the thread that does the installation.  
<li> a new binding is created each time we start counting.
</ul>

Alternatively one could reuse the same binding:

<pre>
MODULE Counter;
        
VAR 
  binding : Dispatcher.Binding;
  counter : INTEGER;

PROCEDURE Counter(...) =
  BEGIN
    INC(counter);
  END Counter;

PROCEDURE Start () =
  BEGIN
    counter := 0;
    Dispatcher.Install(binding);
  END Start;

PROCEDURE Stop (): INTEGER =
  BEGIN
    Dispatcher.Uninstall(binding);
    RETURN counter;
  END Stop;

BEGIN
  binding := Dispatcher.Create(IP.PacketRecv, Count, NIL);
END Counter;
</pre>

Note that:
<ul>
<li> the creation is done in the module initialization and a call to
	<i>Install</i>  activates the binding when the counting is
	started, 
</ul>
