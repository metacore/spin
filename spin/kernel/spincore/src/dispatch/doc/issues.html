Parts of this interface are not available yet and some renaming will
happen for spin-24 to change the old names to those listed here.
Also, result handling is not merged in (should be in spin-24).  

The following parts of the interface are not implement yet:
<ul> 
<li> changing handlers (currently SwapHandlers allows deactivation of
     one and activation of one at the same time)
<li> IsInstalled is not implemented
<li> asynchrony still uses an old interface
</ul>

They should be added within a couple weeks.

Future work includes making object invocations events.
