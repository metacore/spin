<h2> Overview </h2>

The right to handle an event may not imply the right to handle all
occurrences of that event. <i>SPIN</i> provides dynamic access control
over event delivery that ensures that only legitimate handlers receive
an instance of an event raise.  <i>SPIN</i> allows arbitrary
predicates to be imposed on a handler which can be used to restrict
when that handler may execute.  For example, the virtual memory system
may impose a guard that restricts an extension to handling page fault
events only within its own address space.  A predicate applied for the
purpose of limiting access to an event is called an <b> imposed
guard</b>.  Imposed guards enable an event occurrence to be
dynamically checked before it is delivered to a handler.  There may be
more than one imposed guard installed for a binding and the set of
imposed guards for a binding can change in time.

<p>

The binding descriptor is passed only to the authorizer of the event
for which the binding is created and to the caller of binding creation
procedure.  As a result only the module that creates the binding and
the module that control the event (and modules to which they pass the
descriptor) have the capability of installing an imposed guard.

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
PROCEDURE ImposeGuard(binding    : Binding; 
                      guard      : PROCANY;
                      closure    : REFANY := NIL
                     ): ImposedGuard
	             RAISES { Error };

PROCEDURE UnimposeGuard(guard: ImposedGuard)
                       RAISES { Error };
</pre>

<h2> Usage </h2>

<i> ImposeGuard </i> is used to add a guard to the set of imposed
guard for a binding.  The guard can take a closure.  

<p>

<i> UnimposeGuard </i> is used to remove a guard from the set of
imposed guards for a binding.


<h2> Typing rules </h2>

The dispatcher dynamically checks the type of the imposed guard at the time
it is associated with a binding according to the following rules:
<ul>
<li> Procedure types:
<ul>
<li> imposed guard must be procedures (be of type PROCANY),
<li> imposed guard must be legal procedures.
</ul>
<li> Taking closure:
<ul>
<li> an imposed guard must take a closure is the closure argument
	is not <i>NIL</i>,
<li> an imposed guard can take a closure if the corresponding
	closure argument is <i>NIL</i>,
</ul>
<li> No closure:
<ul>
<li> an imposed guard that does not take a closure must have the same number
	and types of arguments as the event for which the binding was
        created but must return result of type <i> BOOLEAN</i>,
</ul>
<li> With closure:
<ul>
<li> if an imposed guard takes a closure than it must have an
	additional argument (first, before all event arguments) of the
	type which is a subtype of <i>REFANY</i>,
</ul>
<li> Closure:
<ul>
<li> a closure argument must be a subtype of the type of the first
	argument of the corresponding procedure argument.
</ul>
</ul>




<h2> Example </h2>

example of use of imposed guards.
