Extensible operating systems require an efficient means to dynamically
bind extensions to existing code.  SPIN provides this functionality
via an event-based invocation mechanism.  Events in SPIN are typed
procedure names that decouple the provider of a service from potential
clients.  Events offer flexible binding via extended procedure call
semantics that support conditional execution, multicast, and
asynchrony.  Extensions communicate with a centralized dispatcher
service to register their interest in handling events.  The dispatcher
implements the invocation semantics and provides protection
guarantees.  Events provide a uniform model of extensibility in which
the configuration of the system can be changed without changing any of
the individual components.  The model uses a simple procedural syntax
of declaration and invocation and allows transparent interposition on
any procedure or object method.  Good performance is obtained through
the use of run-time code generation and integration of the event
mechanisms with the compiler and run-time.
