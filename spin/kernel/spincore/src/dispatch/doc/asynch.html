In <i>SPIN</i> events can be dispatched asynchronously to detach
execution of callees from the execution of the caller either for
performance or safety reasons.  For instance, networking code can pass
a packet to an untrusted extension from interrupt level if it is
guaranteed that control comes back to it fast enough.  One way of
achieving it is to spawn an asynchronous thread for that handler; in
<i> SPIN</i> this can be done transparently by making an event
asynchronous.  An asynchronous event raise creates a thread that
synchronously dispatches the invocation to all the handlers.

<p>

Sometimes it is advantageous to be able to execute asynchronously only
some handlers.  For example, if a file system is extended with lazy
replication then the original code should perform the write
synchronously but the replication can be done asynchronously.  <i>
SPIN </i> allows making handlers asynchronous.  When an event raised
and a handler installed on this event is asynchronous handler then, if
the guards for the handler evaluate to <i> TRUE </i>, a thread is
created to execute that handler.

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
PROCEDURE SetAsynchronousEvent (event        : PROCANY;
                                asynchronous : BOOLEAN;
                                module: RTCode.Module)
                               RAISES { Error };

PROCEDURE SetAsynchronousHandler (binding: Binding;
                                  asynchronous : BOOLEAN)
                                 RAISES { Error };
</pre>

<h2> Usage </h2>

<i>SetAsynchronousEvent</i> is used to make an event asynchronous if
the <i> asynchronous</i> argument is <i> TRUE</i> and synchronous if
it is <i> FALSE</i>.  Accordingly, <i>SetAsynchronousHandler</i> is
used to make a handler asynchronous.
