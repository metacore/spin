SPIN and its extensions are written in Modula-3.  Programs in Modula-3
are written as a composition of modules communicating by procedure
calls through interfaces.  Fundamentally, a procedure call is a signal
from one module to another to indicate or request a change in the
system state.  In effect, a procedure call is an event <b> raised </b>
by the caller and <b> handled </b> by the procedure's implementation.
We exploit this relationship to define events in SPIN.

<p>

<b> Events </b> are a metaphor for extended procedure calls.  They are
defined in terms of Modula-3 procedure signatures, which preserves the
natural invocation syntax and the ``feel'' of the language.
Consequently, an event is a typed and named message that may carry
arguments and return a value.  Every procedure and object method is
implicitly an event and hence eligible for extension.  Events declared
in an interface are available for modules that import that interface
to either raise the event, or to provide additional handlers for the
event.  Events not declared in an interface can be explicitly passed
between modules as procedure variables.

<p>

A <b> handler </b> is a procedure that is registered to receive
invocations of an event.  Handlers can be dynamically added to or
removed from an event.  One, multiple or no handlers can be <a
href="simple.html"> installed </a> on an event at any particular time.
The same handler can be installed on any number of events in which
case it will be invoked independently for each of them.

<p>

Each event handler may be associated with a set of <b> guard </b>
predicates, which are used to filter out unwanted event raises.  A
handler is executed only if all of its guards evaluate to TRUE.  For
example, an extension may only be interestd in handling page fault
events for its data segment, and can define a guard that checks
whether the particular virtual address where the fault occurred is in
that segment.  The predicate is specified outside of the handler to
separate the specification of extension code from the specification of
the binding properties.  Separation allows the same handler to be
installed on many events, or on the same event many times with
different guards.

<p>

An <b>imposed guard </b> is a guard installed with a handler for the
purpose of limiting access of that handler to an event.  Imposed
guards enable an event occurrence to be dynamically checked before it
is delivered to a handler.

<p>

A <b> binding </b> associates a handler and its guards with an event.
A binding is <b> active </b> if it is currently installed on an event
and <b> inactive </b> otherwise.  If a binding is active its handler
receives all instances of event raises for which all of its guards
evaluated to TRUE.  Otherwise, the handler does not receive event
raises through this binding.  The same handler may be used in a number
of bindings, possibly for different events, and it may be installed
for some of them and uninstalled for others.  Each installation of
such handler receives event raises independently, so the same
procedure used as a handler can be invoked many times for the same
event raise and be invoked by different events.

<p>

An event is defined by a procedure definition.  It has the same name
and type as the procedure that defines it.  The implementation of the
procedure becomes this event's <b> original handler </b> which is
always (unconditionally) executed unless it is uninstalled.

<p>

An event's <b> primary implementation module </b> is the module that
defines the original handler for the event.  This module is
responsible for maintaining properties of the event.  The identity of
the primary implementation of the module is required as a key to allow
using <a href="auth.html"> authorization </a> to limit the access to
the event.

<p>

A centralized <b> event dispatcher </b> implements the event machinery
which includes binding handlers to events, evaluating guards, and
invoking handlers.

<p>

A <b> closure </b> is a data structure associated with either a
handler or a guard procedure to provide it with static data specific
to the binding.  A closure is bound with a
procedure at the time a binding is <a href="simple.html">created</a>.
A handler or a guard <b>takes a closure</b> if an additional argument
(a closure) is passed to it at the time of event raise besides the
arguments of the event raise.  A closure is a constant pointer that
cannot be changed without reinstalling the binding with which it is
associated.

<p>

A <b> legal procedure </b> is a procedure that can be used by the 
dispatcher as a handler, guard, or event.  All Modula-3 procedures (except
for nested procedures) are automatically legal. Non-Modula-3
procedures can be made legal explicitely.
A nested Modula-3 procedure cannot be made legal.
