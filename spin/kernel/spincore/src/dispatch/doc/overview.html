SPIN supports extensibility by allowing application code to interpose
on kernel interfaces.  These system extensions are directly linked
into the kernel address space, and their memory safety is guaranteed
by writing them in a type-safe programming language (Modula-3).
Interposition is implemented using an event-based invocation mechanism
that centralizes all communication through the SPIN dispatcher
service.  The dispatcher allows extensions to dynamically change the
body of code executed in response to a service request.  Because the
dispatcher is involved in all communication, it is able to implement
access control and provide a consistent semantics of interposition on
that communication.

<p>

Events provide a uniform programming model for extensibility.  Events
are specified using Modula-3 procedure syntax, and event invocation
semantics, as observed by callers and callees, is that of a Modula-3
procedure call.  Events also provide a uniform way of specifying
extension configurations.  A single interface, the event dispatcher,
is used to specify bindings and their properties.  A third aspect of
event uniformity is the fact that any procedure in the system is
automatically eligible for extensions.    

<H2> Example </H2>

The following code declares a procedure <i>Syscall</i> within a <a
href="../../machine/MachineTrap.i3"> <i>MachineTrap</i> interface </a>.  This declaration
becomes automatically a declaration of a <i> MachineTrap.Syscall</i>
<a href="model.html">event</a>.

<pre>
INTERFACE MachineTrap;

PROCEDURE Syscall(strand: Strand.T; VAR ms: MachineCPU.SavedState);

END MachineTrap.
</pre>

This procedures is implemented in the <a href="../../machine/MachineTrap.i3">
<i>MachineTrap</i> module </a>.  It provides the default <i> SPIN</i>
syscalls available to all user space programs.  The procedure becomes
also automatically a <a href="model.html">handler</a> for the <i>
MachineTrap.Syscall</i> event.

<pre>
UNSAFE MODULE MachineTrap; (* unsafe because of loophole *)

PROCEDURE Syscall(<*UNUSED*>strand: Strand.T; VAR ss: MachineCPU.SavedState) =
  BEGIN
    CASE ss.v0 OF
    | 0 =>
    | 1 => Strand.Block(Strand.GetCurrent());
    | 5 => IO.Put(Fmt.Char(VAL(ss.a0, CHAR)));
    | 6 => IO.Put("User Print: 0x" & Fmt.Unsigned(ss.a0) & "\n");
    | 43 => Strand.Yield();
    ELSE
    END;
  END Syscall;

BEGIN
END MachineTrap.
</pre>

The USTSyscall</a> module implements a procedure
(<i>Syscall</i>) that provides additional syscalls for programs that
use user space threads.  This procedure is installed as an additional
handler for the <i> MachineTrap.Syscall</i> event by calling the event
dispatcher. As a result, this procedure is <b>imposed</b> on the
original procedure that implemented the event and from now on, the two
procedures together provide the functionality that is the new
implementation of the event. Each time the <i> MachineTrap.Syscall</i>
procedure is called (which is equivalent to raising the <i>
MachineTrap.Syscall</i> event) both procedures are executed.

<pre>
MODULE USTSyscall;

PROCEDURE Syscall(ss: REF Machine.SavedState) =
  BEGIN
    ...
  END Syscall;

BEGIN
    ...
    EVAL Dispatcher.InstallHandler(MachineTrap.Syscall, NIL, Syscall);
    ...
END USTSyscall.
</pre>


<h2> Goals </h2>

The goal of the events is to provide a binding mechanism for extensitions.
We expect such a mechanism to exhibit four features:

<ul>
<li> it should be <b> expressive </b> to provide flexibility in
	composing extensions,
<li> it should be <b> simple </b> to simplify writing extensions and
	extending existing code,
<li> it should be <b> safe </b> to maintain protection guarantees
	given by the system,
<li> it should have <b> good performance </b> so that extensibility
	can happen at a fine grain.
</ul>


Expressiveness is achieved in <i> SPIN </i> by flexible semantics of
event based invocation: multiple procedures can be imposed on a single
procedure call, the procedures can be executed conditionally, and they
can be invoked asynchronously.  Simplicity is achieved by providing a
uniform model of extensibility: all procedures can be extended and
events use procedure syntax and procedure call semantics.  Safety is
guaranteed by making events typesafe and providing mechanisms like <a
href="auth.html">authorization</a> and <a href="imposed.html"> imposed
guards</a> that allow enforcing safety.  Good performance is achieved
by integrating event mechanisms with the Modula-3 runtime and by using
run-time code generation to optimize invocations.
