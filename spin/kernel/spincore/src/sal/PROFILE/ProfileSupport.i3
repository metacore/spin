 * HISTORY
 * 29-Jul-96  Charles Garrett (garrett) at the University of Washington
 *	Added SetNumArcs.
 *
 * 29-May-96  Charles Garrett (garrett) at the University of Washington
 *	Added the Flush command and the option to keep previous profile
 *	 data when calling On.
 *
 * 05-May-96  Charles Garrett (garrett) at the University of Washington
 *	Created. This is the procedural interface to profiling. In order
 *	 to gather a profile, you should call StartGprof, then execute
 *	 your code and then call StopGprof. Be sure to read out the
 *	 information before you call StartGprof again, because it will 
 *	 overwrite the earlier profiles.
