<h1>Protection Domains</h1>

<p>The SPIN protection domain interface enables applications that reside
in the same address space to share as well as protect their code and data.
More specifically, the domain interface allows applications to draw protection
boundaries around themselves that are traditionally provided by hardware
mechanisms on conventional systems. Further, the same interface enables
applications to pass direct references to their code and data to other
modules, hence eliminating the costly protection boundary crossings 
necessitated by conventional systems.

<p>
The WCSSS paper</a> on domains further explains the general
concepts behind domains and gives an overview of the interface.
Essentially, <a href="index.html#domainint">the domain interface</a> is a veneer
over dynamic linking which enables applications to share and protect
as much or as little of their code and data as they desire. The
primitives allow arbitrary nesting of domains, which simplifies domain
management. A <a href=index.html#shellcommand>kernel shell command</a> provides
access to primitives from the command line. A <a href="index.html#staticint">set
of templates and build tools</a> help create domain management code
automatically.

<a name=domainint>
<h2>Domain Interface</h2>

The run-time interface to protection domains consists of the
following operations:

<p>

<br><b>Create(objectfile: REF ARRAY OF CHAR) : T</b>
<br><b>CreateFromInterface(interface: RTCode.InterfaceUnit) : T</b>
<br>These operations enable an application to create a new domain. 
Create takes an object file in native format as an argument. For example, 
on the alpha, the domain implementation expects Alpha ECOFF. Create parses
the object file format and returns a runtime handle that describes the 
resources that are in the given domain. More specifically, a domain handle
acts as a capability to the symbols exported by that piece of code. That is,
if the object file defines a variable, procedure or interface <b>Foo</b>,
the domain handle acts as a capability to Foo. Clients will need to link
with the Foo domain in order to be able to access the function Foo. In
addition to acting as a capability to the exported symbols, a domain
provides a handle to the underlying object code and can be used to 
manipulate it. The domain handle embodies all external references made by the
domain to symbols defined by other domains, and subsequent domain
operations such as <b>Resolve</b> can be used to manipulate them.

<p>
CreateFromInterface is similar to Create in that it creates a new
domain that acts as a capability to the named interface. The argument
is of type RTCode.InterfaceUnit. A typical client will obtain an interface
handle via a call to INTERFACE_UNIT() with any interface as an argument.
For instance, INTERFACE_UNIT(Foo) will return a runtime handle for the 
<b>Foo</b> interface, which the client can then pass to CreateFromInterface
to obtain a domain that contains the interface Foo.

<p>
<br><b>Resolve(mapper, mappee: T)</b>
<b>Resolve</b> enables one domain to import the symbols defined in another
domain. Any outstanding reference to a symbol in the mapper domain that
is unresolved and of the same type as an exported symbol in the mappee
domain will be resolved to the mappee domain. Following this operation,
a record is made of the fact that the mapper was linked against the mappee.

<p>
<br><b>Unresolve(mapper, mappee: T)</b>
<b>Unresolve</b> enables one domain to "unimport" the references it acquired
to another domain. It is the dual of Resolve, in that it performs unlinking.
Any reference to a symbol in the mapper domain that was previously 
resolved to an exported symbol in the mappee
domain will revert to unresolved.

<p>
<br><b>Add(container, element: T)</b>
Domains can contain other domains. <b>Add</b> enables one domain to be
contained within a higher level domain. Through <b>Add</b>, domains can
form trees that contain arbitrary numbers of smaller subdomains. This 
facilitates capability management, especially for applications that export
or import a number of related interfaces.

<p>
<br><b>Delete(container, element: T)</b>
<b>Delete</b> is the complement of <b>Add</b> in that it allows a contained
domain to be taken out of the container. It is used to manage sets of 
capabilities.

<p>
<br><b>Initialize(mapper, mappee: T) : BOOLEAN</b>
<b>Initialize</b> integrates a fully resolved domain with the rest of the
runtime. It performs various integrity checks to make sure that the
resulting program is valid, and runs any initialization code. For Modula-3,
this consists of type-integrity checking, followed by execution of 
module bodies. It returns false upon failure. The main bodies are run
in the context of the thread that called Initialize.

<a name=staticint>
<h2>Static Interface</h2>

<p>
Most clients use the preceding rich interface in stylized ways. We have
extracted these boilerplate templates into a set of build-time
templates.

<p>
Applications can specify which domains they will be importing and
exporting at build time. They do this by using a set of
primitives in m3makefiles. The primitives are:

<dl>
<dt><b>Package(DomainName)</b>
<dd>Indicates that the extension should be placed in a domain named
DomainName. This domain should be automatically registered with the
name server after successful initialization. In the current
implementation, this export step needs to be done manually by the
programmer, who can then specify an appropriate authorizer. In the
near future, the package primitive will perform the export
automatically and the programmer will specify the authorizer as part
of a generic instantiation.

<dt><b>DomainImport(ImportedDomainName, PathToDirectory, DirectoryName, SearchPath)</b>
<dd>Imports the named domain from the specified location in the
filesystem. The interfaces in the exported domain become visible in
the importing domain. A missing DomainImport will cause the compiler
to complain about interfaces that are not found.

<p>Various quake complications make the DomainImport arguments more
complicated and numerous than they need to be. The second argument is
the path from the spin root to the parent directory containing the
package of interest (e.g. "user/thread"). The third argument is the
name of the directory itself that the package is located in
(e.g. "cthread"). Finally, the last argument indicates where the
package should come from in the filesystem. It is a search path of
(potentially sparsely populated) SPIN tree roots. A typical example
will be an overridepath that contains THISTREE and FULLTREE. For current
usage, it is best to look at the hello example.

<dt><b>Module/module</b>
<dd>A <b>Module</b> primitive (with the capital M) indicates that the
specified module should be exported as part of the domain that is
named in the Package primitive. <b>module</b> (with a small m)
indicates that the module is private and should not be exported.
</dl>


The m3makefile in the hello extension demonstrates the use of the 
static interface in creating domains.

<a name=shellcommand>
<h2>Domain Shell Command</h2>

The <b>domain</b> command provides a way to access the primitive
domain operations from the <a href="../../../../../user/shell/doc/index.html">kernel shell</a> command line.
These commands are one-to-one with the preceding operations
in the primitive domain interface.

<p>
<br><b>create domainname</b>
<br>Creates a new domain with
<b>Domain.Create</b>. The domain name is any arbitrary string. It is
registered with the nameserver upon creation. The domain is empty
upon creation.

<p>
<br><b>add domainname filename</b>
<br>Creates a new anonymous domain with
<b>Domain.Create</b>, and makes it a subdomain of the named domain.
The named file should be a pathname to a valid object file.

<p>
<br><b>link mappername mappeename</b>
<br><b>Resolve</b>s the mapper domain against the mappee domain.

<p>
<br><b>debug domainname</b>
<br>Prints out a list of all unresolved symbols in the named domain.

<p>
<br><b>run domainname</b>
<br><b>Initialize</b>s the named domain.
