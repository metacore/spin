The SRC Modula-3 garbage collector is partially copying which means
that some objects change their memory location over time as they may
be moved during collection. The only objects which are guaranteed to
remain in their position during collection are those pointed to by
ambiguous roots.  An ambiguous root is a value in memory which is
conservatively treated by the collector as a pointer.  Examples of
ambiguous pointers are values on the stack or saved registers if those
values can be interpreted as a pointer to some objects in the traced
heap.

A strong reference is an additional reference to an object created to
make the object uncollectible even if no other reference exists and to
prevent the object from being moved by the collector.  Strong
references are used where collectible (traced) objects are embedded in
data structures that are not scanned by the collector (e.g., passed to 
C code which places that in its global variables or embedded inside of
run-time generated code). 

<h2> Interface </h2>
<pre>
PROCEDURE Add(ref: REFANY);

PROCEDURE Remove(ref: REFANY);

PROCEDURE IsThere(ref: REFANY) : BOOLEAN; 
</pre>


The <i>StrongRef</i> interface maintains a counter of how many strong
references were created for a given reference.  If the count is
greater than zero then the object pointed to by the reference become
uncollectible and immobilized.  The object becomes collectible and
mobile again after the count drops to zero.

A strong reference is created by a call to <i>StrongRef.Add</i> and
disposed of by a call to <i>StrongRef.Remove</i>.  Strong references
are kept internally by the implementation of the <i>StrongRef</i>
interface and are not exported to its users.  The original reference
to an object for which a strong reference is created is passed to this
interface.  A call to <i>IsThere</i> returns <i>TRUE</i> if a strong
reference for the argument reference currently exists.
