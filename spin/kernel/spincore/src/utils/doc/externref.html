<H2>Overview</H2>

SPIN kernel resources are accessed through capabilities.  SPIN implements 
capabilities using pointers, which are statically prohibited by Modula-3 
to be forged or dereferenced in a way inconsistent with their types.
User-level applications often need to maintain a handle on a kernel
resource.  However, due to Modula-3 type restrictions, pointers cannot
be passed across the user-kernel boundary.
<p>
Therefore, SPIN provides the externalized reference utility.  Externalized
references are a means of associating an integer value with a Modula-3
pointer.  This integer value can then be passed to and from user-level
applications without violating any language restrictions.  
<p>
Externalized reference associations usually occur on a per-application
basis, but one can be instantiated by any kernel entity.

<H2>Design and Implementation</H2> 

<h3>Externalized References and SPIN</h3>
Externalized references are a utility provided by the SPIN kernel.  
Externalized references rely on no trusted SPIN resources which would 
not be available to arbitrary extensions.  Similarly, no SPIN core 
services rely upon externalized references.
<p>
Currently, each Space.T is instantiated with externalized reference
facilities.  <a href="../../../../../user/vm/doc/index.html">Spaces</a> are statically 
linked extensions which support user-level address spaces.

<h3>Basic Model</h3>
Externalized references are based on the Modula-3 <a href=
"http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/m3sources/html/table/src/Table.ig.html">
Table</a> generic.  The externalized reference table is a mapping from 
integers to REFANYs, where the integer is an index into the table and the
REFANY holds the kernel reference.  
<p>
When externalizing a reference, clients may specify an index into the 
mapping table.  If that table entry is in use, the old reference will
be overwritten.  If the client does not specify an index, an unused index 
is automatically chosen.  
<p>
Access to capabilities stored in an externalized reference table is 
controlled by the entity which holds the table.  For instance, with the
current Space.T implementation, holding a capability to the Space.T also
allows access to the externalized reference table through methods provided
by the <a href=
"../../../../../user/vm/space/src/Space.i3">
Space.i3</a> interface.
<p>
An in-kernel reference can be externalized many times.  Ideally, to keep the
size of the table manageable and efficient, a reference should not appear 
twice in the same table.  That is, when externalizing a reference, it should
first be determined that an existing Word.T externalized reference cannot be
used.
<p>
An efficient way to perform this check would be a reverse table lookup.
The Modula-3 <a href=
"http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/m3sources/html/table/src/Table.ig.html">
Table</a> generic does not provide a reverse lookup method.  Therefore, a
reverse table can be maintained for each externalalized reference table.
However, the reverse table evaluates hash functions on REFANY types.
If the Modula-3 garbage collector then moves the referent and updates the
REFANY, the hash function would evaluate differently.  Modula-3 strongrefs
and weakrefs are used to defeat this problem.

<H2>Using Externalized References</H2>

<h3>Interface</h3>
The interface to externalized references is <a href=
"../ExternalRef.i3">
ExternalRef.i3</a>.

<h3>Examples</h3>


Once an externalized reference table has been created, it is most frequently
accessed with the Externalize() and Internalize() procedures.  Externalize()
returns a Word.T externalized reference:
<pre><b>

IMPORT Foo, ExternalRef;
...
PROCEDURE ExampleOfExternalization(myExternTable: ExternalRef.T; ...) ...
  VAR
    fooref: REF Foo.T := NEW(REF Foo.T);
    extref: Word.T;
    ...
  BEGIN
    ...
    extref := ExternalRef.Externalize(myExternTable, fooref);
    ...
  END ExampleOfExternalization;

</b></pre>
<p>
Similarly, Internalize() returns a REFANY which can be narrowed into the
appropriate type:
<pre><b>

IMPORT Foo, ExternalRef;
...
PROCEDURE ExampleOfInternalization(myExternTable: ExternalRef.T;
                                   extref:        Word.T;
                                   ... ) ...
  VAR
    fooref: REF Foo.T;
    ...
  BEGIN
    ...
    fooref := NARROW(ExternalRef.Interalize(myExternTable, extref), REF Foo.T);
    ...
  END ExampleOfInteralization;

</b></pre>

<H2>Remaining Issues</H2>

An external reference table is currently part of each Space object.  
Ideally, though, only those clients which need external reference tables
should allocate them.  The external reference table can be removed from
the Space object.  Then, clients which require externalized references 
can create a customized address space representation which inherits from
the general Space object.
