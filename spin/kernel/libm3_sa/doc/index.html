<h1>
Standard M3 Libraries

<h2> Motivation </h2>
Every programming language has its library of basic data structures and
algorithms and Modula-3 is no exception. We have noticed that these 
libraries emphasize correctness and safety at the expense of speed. 

<h2> Overview </h2>

The libm3 library contains basic data structures
such as lists, tables, sequences and atoms as well as procedures to implement
formatted I/O and random number generation.

<P>

For SPIN, we have made standalone versions of these libararies which
contain the standard library services that we need while omitting 
some that we don't need. These libraries are statically linked with
the kernel and some of the standard library interfaces, such as
Thread, are now implemented by SPIN kernel code.

<h2> The contents of libm3_sa </h2>
This list contains the subdirectories of the libm3_sa directory.

<dd> "An Atom.T is a unique representative for a set of equal texts."
	In other words, the two TEXT's "alpha" and "alpha" may not be
	equal REF's, but the result of calling Atom.FromText() will be
	the same REF for both of them. This is useful if you have to test
	strings for equality many times. You just have to convert them
	to Atom.T's once and then compare the Atom.T's.
<p>
<dt> <A href="fmtlex.html">fmtlex</A>
<dd>	Fmt and Lex are interfaces for INTEGER's, Float's and BOOLEAN's
	into TEXT's and vice versa.
<p>
<dt> <A href="list.html">list</A>
<dd>	A generic list interface. AtomList's are instantiated.
<p>
<dt> <A href="random.html">random</A>
<dd>	A random number generator.
<p>
<dt> <A href="rw.html">rw</A>
<dd>	Readers and writers are stream abstractions for getting and putting
	groups of characters.
<p>
<dt> <A href="sequence.html">sequence</A>
<dd>	A generic interface for an extensible sequence.
<p>
<dt> sort
<dd>	This generic interface defines a procedure which will sort arrays
	of Elem.T's using QuickSort.
<p>
<dt> <A href="sortedtable.html">sortedtable</A>
<dd>	A sorted table is a table with its keys in sorted order.
<p>
<dt> <A href="table.html">table</A>
<dd>	A table is a mapping of keys to values. AtomAtomTbl's and TextRefTbl's
	are instantiated.
<p>
<dt> types
<dd>	Some interfaces which permit CHAR, BOOLEAN, INTEGER and REFANY
	to be used as formal imports for generic interfaces. For example,
	Boolean.T is BOOLEAN and Char.Equal is just "=".
