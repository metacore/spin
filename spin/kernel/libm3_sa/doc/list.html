<h2> Overview </h2>
The List interface is an example of a generic interface. It can hold
any type of data, as long as that data is declared to be type T in
some interface and the interface declares an appropriate Brand constant
and Equal procedure. Be careful when using the Nth() procedure for
a List, because it searches from the beginning of the list every
time which can make iterating over the list very expensive.

<h2> The Details </h2>

<h3> The List interface </h3>

<pre>
GENERIC INTERFACE List(Elem);
</pre>
Where "Elem.T" is not an open array type and "Elem" contains
<pre>
| CONST Brand = <text-constant>;
| PROCEDURE Equal(k1, k2: Elem.T): BOOLEAN;
</pre>
   "Brand" must be a text constant. It will be used to construct a brand for
   any generic types instantiated with the "List" interface. For a non-generic
   interface, we recommend choosing the name of the interface.
<p>
   "Equal" may be declared with a parameter mode of either "VALUE" or
   "READONLY", but not "VAR".
<p>
 A "List.T" represents a linked list of items of type "Elem.T".
<p>
 None of the operations of this interface modify the "head" field of
   an existing list element.  Operations that may modify the "tail"
   field of existing list elements are called <em> destructive </em>.  By
   convention, their names end in "D".
<p>

<h3> The ListSort interface </h3>
 The generic interface "ListSort" extends the generic interface
   "List" with sorting operations.

<pre>
GENERIC INTERFACE ListSort(Elem, ElemList);
</pre>
Where "Elem.T" is not an open array type, "ElemList" equals "List(Elem)",
   and "Elem" contains
<pre>
| CONST Brand = <text-constant>;
| PROCEDURE Compare(e1, e2: Elem.T): [-1..1];
</pre>
   "Brand" must be a text constant. It will be used to construct a brand for
   any generic types instantiated with the "ListSort" interface. For a
   non-generic interface, we recommend choosing the name of the interface.
<p>
   "Compare" must be a total order. It may be declared with any parameter
   mode, but must have no visible side-effects.
<p>
The implementation is time- and cons-efficient but not guaranteed
   to be stable.  "Sort" copies the cells; "SortD" modifies the "tail"
   fields of the existing cells.
