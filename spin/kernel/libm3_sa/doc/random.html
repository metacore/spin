<h1>
Random Number Generator
</h1>
<HR>

A "Random.T" (or just a generator) is a pseudo-random number
   generator.
<p>

<p>
Individual generators are unmonitored, and all the operations
   have side effects.
<p>  
   The methods provided by a generator "rand" are:
<p> 
   The call "rand.integer(a, b)" returns a uniformly distributed
   "INTEGER" in the closed interval "[a..b]".
<p> 
   The call "rand.boolean()" returns a random "BOOLEAN" value.
<p> 
   It is a checked runtime error if "min > max" on any call.
<p> 
   "NEW(Default).init()" creates and initializes a generator (see
   below for implementation details).  If "fixed" is "TRUE", a
   predetermined sequence is used.  If "fixed" is "FALSE", "init"
   chooses a random seed in such a way that different sequences result
   even if "init" is called many times in close proximity.
<p> 
A good pseudo-random permutation of an array "a"
   can be generated as follows:
<pre>
| WITH rand = NEW(Random.Default).init() DO
|   FOR i := FIRST(a) TO LAST(a) - 1 DO
|     WITH j = rand.integer(i, LAST(a)) DO
|       `Exchange "a[i]" and "a[j]"`
|     END
|   END
| END
</pre>
The object returned
   by a call of "New(Default).init" uses an additive generator based
   on Knuth's Algorithm 3.2.2A (see Knuth:Vol2).
