<h2> The Sequence interface </h2>
 A "Sequence(Elem).T" (or just a {\it sequence}) represents an
   extensible sequence of "Elem.T"s.  
<p>     
   The first group of methods have side effects on the sequence.  The
   call
<p>     

| s.init(sizeHint)
<p>     

   initializes "s" to be the empty sequence.  Furthermore "init"
   assumes that at least "sizeHint" elements will be added to the
   sequence; these operations may be executed more efficiently than if
   "sizeHint" was defaulted.  The call
<p>     

| s.fromArray(a)
<p>     

   initializes "s" to be the sequence with elements
   "a[0],~...,~a[LAST(a)]".  The call
<p>     

| s.addhi(x)
<p>     

   appends "x" to the end of "s".  Thus it does not change the index
   of any existing element.  The call
<p>     

| s.addlo(x)
<p>     

   appends "x" to the front of "s".  Thus it increases the index of
   all existing elements by one. The call
<p>  
| s.remhi()
<p>
   removes and returns the last element of "s".  Thus it does not
   change the index of any of "s"'s other elements.  If "s" is empty,
   "s.remhi()" causes a checked runtime error.  The call
<p>
| s.remlo()
<p>
   removes and returns the first element of "s".  Thus it decreases
   the index of all other elements of "s" by one. If "s" is empty,
   "s.remlo()" causes a checked runtime error.  The call
<p>
| s.put(i, x)
<p>
   replaces element "i" of "s" with "x".  Element "0" is the first
   element. It is a checked runtime error unless "i" is less than
   "s.size()".
<p>
   The second group of methods have no side effect on the sequence.
   The call
<p>
| s.size()
<p>
   returns the number of elements in "s".  The call
<p>
| s.get(i)
<p>
   returns element "i" of "s". It is a checked runtime error unless
   "i" is less than "s.size()".  The call
<p>
| s.gethi()
<p>
   returns the last element of "s"; that is, it is equivalent to
   "s.get(s.size()-1)".  The call
<p>
| s.getlo()
<p>
   returns the first element of "s"; that is, it is equivalent to
   "s.get(0)".
