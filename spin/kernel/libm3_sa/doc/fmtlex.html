<h2> Motivation </h2>
In Modula-3 you use the Fmt interface to transform
data from machine representation to human readable TEXTs and 
the Lex and Scan interfaces to go the other way.

<h2> Overview </h2>
The Fmt and Lex interfaces are rather narrow because of safety
restrictions. For example, the "Systems Programming with Modula-3"
book describes a Fmt.Addr procedure which would turn an address
into a TEXT containing digits. This has been removed from the
distributed interface because you could use it to format an
address and read it back in as an integer, violating type safety.
In SPIN, we have restricted them even more by disabling the support
for floating-point numbers.

<h2> The Details </h2>

<h3> The Fmt interface </h3>

The SRC library contains an interface called Fmt which produces
TEXT's with nice formatting. The elementary procedures accept
BOOLEAN's, CHAR's, INTEGER's and Word.T's and return TEXT's.
There is also a Pad() procedure which takes a TEXT and some
instructions for padding it and returns the padded TEXT. There
are two procedures which implement something like printf
functionality. Here are their descriptions:

<pre>

PROCEDURE F(fmt: TEXT; t1, t2, t3, t4, t5: TEXT := NIL)
  : TEXT;
(* Uses "fmt" as a format string. The result is a copy of "fmt" in
   which all format specifiers have been replaced, in order, by the
   text arguments "t1", "t2", etc. *)
</pre>
 A format specifier contains a field width, alignment and one of two
   padding characters. The procedure "F" evaluates the specifier and
   replaces it by the corresponding text argument padded as it would
   be by a call to "Pad" with the specified field width, padding
   character and alignment.
<p>
   The syntax of a format specifier is:
| %[-]{0-9}s
   that is, a percent character followed by an optional minus sign, an
   optional number and a compulsory terminating "s".
<p>
   If the minus sign is present the alignment is "Align.Left",
   otherwise it is "Align.Right". The alignment corresponds to the
   "align" argument to "Pad".
<p>
   The number specifies the field width (this corresponds to the
   "length" argument to "Pad"). If the number is omitted it defaults
   to zero.
<p>
   If the number is present and starts with the digit "0" the padding character
   is "'0'"; otherwise it is the space character. The padding character
   corresponds to the "padChar" argument to "Pad".
<p>
   It is a checked runtime error if "fmt" is "NIL" or the number of
   format specifiers in "fmt" is not equal to the number of non-nil
   arguments to "F".
<p>
   Non-nil arguments to "F" must precede any "NIL" arguments; it is a
   checked runtime error if they do not.
<p>
   If "t1" to "t5" are all "NIL" and "fmt" contains no format
   specifiers, the result is "fmt".
<p>
   Examples:
<pre>
| F("%s %s\n", "Hello", "World") `returns` "Hello World\n".
| F("%s", Int(3))                `returns` "3"
| F("%2s", Int(3))               `returns` " 3"
| F("%-2s", Int(3))              `returns` "3 "
| F("%02s", Int(3))              `returns` "03"
| F("%-02s", Int(3))             `returns` "30"
| F("%s", "%s")                  `returns` "%s"
| F("%s% tax", Int(3))           `returns` "3% tax"

   The following examples are legal but pointless:
| F("%-s", Int(3))               `returns` "3"
| F("%0s", Int(3))               `returns` "3"
| F("%-0s", Int(3))              `returns` "3"


PROCEDURE FN(fmt: TEXT; READONLY texts: ARRAY OF TEXT)
  : TEXT;
(* Similar to "F" but accepts an array of text arguments. It is a
   checked runtime error if the number of format specifiers in "fmt"
   is not equal to "NUMBER(texts)" or if any element of "texts" is
   "NIL". If "NUMBER(texts) = 0" and "fmt" contains no format
   specifiers the result is "fmt". *)

Example:

| FN("%s %s %s %s %s %s %s",
|   ARRAY OF TEXT{"Too", "many", "arguments",
|     "for", "F", "to", "handle"})

   returns {\tt \char'42Too many arguments for F to handle\char'42}.

</pre>


<h3> The Lex interface </h3>
Here are the comments from Lex.i3:
<p>
 The "Lex" interface provides procedures for reading strings,
   booleans, integers, and floating-point numbers from an input
   stream.  Similar functionality on text strings is available
   from the "Scan" interface.
<p>

 Each of the procedures in this interface reads a specified prefix
   of the characters in the reader passed to the procedure, and leaves
   the reader positioned immediately after that prefix, perhaps at
   end-of-file.  Each procedure may call "Rd.UngetChar" after its
   final call on "Rd.GetChar".

<pre> 
PROCEDURE Scan(
    rd: Rd.T; READONLY cs: SET OF CHAR := NonBlanks): TEXT 
  RAISES {Rd.Failure, Alerted};
(* Read the longest prefix of "rd" composed of characters in "cs" and
   return that prefix as a "TEXT".  *)

PROCEDURE Skip(
    rd: Rd.T; READONLY cs: SET OF CHAR := Blanks)
  RAISES {Rd.Failure, Alerted};
(* Read the longest prefix of "rd" composed of characters in "cs" and
   discard it.  *)

(* Whenever a specification of one of the procedures mentions skipping
   blanks, this is equivalent to performing the call "Skip(rd, Blanks)". *)

PROCEDURE Match(rd: Rd.T; t: TEXT)
  RAISES {Error, Rd.Failure, Alerted};
(* Read the longest prefix of "rd" that is also a prefix of "t".
   Raise "Error" if that prefix is not, in fact, equal to all of "t". *)

PROCEDURE Bool(rd: Rd.T): BOOLEAN RAISES {Error, Rd.Failure, Alerted};
(* Read a boolean from "rd" and return its value. *)

(* "Bool" skips blanks, then reads the longest prefix of "rd" that is
   a prefix of a "Boolean" in the following grammar:

| Boolean = "F" "A" "L" "S" "E" | "T" "R" "U" "E".

   The case of letters in a "Boolean" is not significant.  If the
   prefix read from "rd" is an entire "Boolean", "Bool" returns that
   boolean; else it raises "Error".  *)

PROCEDURE Int(rd: Rd.T; defaultBase: [2..16] := 10)
  : INTEGER RAISES {Error, Rd.Failure, Alerted};
PROCEDURE Unsigned(rd: Rd.T; defaultBase: [2..16] := 16)
  : Word.T RAISES {Error, Rd.Failure, Alerted};
(* Read a number from "rd" and return its value. *)
</pre>

 Each procedure skips blanks, then reads the longest prefix of "rd"
   that is a prefix of a "Number" as defined by the grammar below.  If
   "defaultBase" exceeds 10, then the procedure scans for a
   "BigBaseNum"; otherwise it scans for a "SmallBaseNum".  The effect
   of this rule is that the letters 'a' through 'f' and 'A' through
   'F' stop the scan unless either the "defaultBase" or the explicitly
   provided base exceeds 10.  "Unsigned" omits the scan for a "Sign".
<pre>
| Number       = [Sign] (SmallBaseNum | BigBaseNum).
| SmallBaseNum = DecVal | BasedInt.
| BigBaseNum   = HexVal | BasedInt.
| BasedInt     = SmallBase "_" DecVal | BigBase "_" HexVal.
| DecVal       = Digit {Digit}.
| HexVal       = HexDigit {HexDigit}.
| Sign         = "+" | "-".
| SmallBase    = "2" | "3" | ... | "10".
| BigBase      = "11" | "12" | ... | "16".
| Digit        = "0" | "1" | ... | "9".
| HexDigit     = Digit | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F"
|                      | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f".
</pre>
   If the prefix read from "rd" is an entire "Number" (as described
   above), the corresponding number is returned; else "Error" is
   raised.
<p>
   If an explicit base is given with an underscore, it is interpreted
   in decimal.  In this case, the digits in "DecVal" or "HexVal" are
   interpreted in the explicit base, else they are interpreted in the
   "defaultBase".

<h3> The Scan interface </h3>
<pre>
(* The "Scan" interface provides procedures for reading strings,
   booleans, integers, and floating-point numbers from a text string.
   Similar functionality on readers is availble from the "Lex"
   interface. *)

(* Each of these procedures parses a string of characters and converts
   it to a binary value.  Leading and trailing blanks (ie. characters
   in "Lex.Blanks") are ignored.  "Lex.Error" is raised if the first
   non-blank substring is not generated by the corresponding "Lex"
   grammar or if there are zero or more than one non-blank substrings.
   "FloatMode.Trap" is raised as per "Lex". *)

PROCEDURE Bool(txt: TEXT): BOOLEAN
  RAISES {Lex.Error};

PROCEDURE Int(txt: TEXT; defaultBase: [2..16] := 10): INTEGER
  RAISES {Lex.Error};
PROCEDURE Unsigned(txt: TEXT; defaultBase: [2..16] := 16): Word.T
  RAISES {Lex.Error};
</pre>

<h2> Using the interfaces </h2>

<h3> Fmt </h3>
Here are some examples of using Fmt to produce a TEXT from a basic
data type:

<pre>
Procedure Call					Output TEXT
--------------					-----------
Fmt.Char('a');					"a"
Fmt.Int(43);					"43"
Fmt.Unsigned(106);				"8a"
Fmt.Bool(TRUE);					"TRUE"
</pre>

The Pad procedure can be used to adjust the width of the TEXT
and fill in empty space with padding characters:
<pre>
Procedure Call					Output TEXT
--------------					-----------
Fmt.Pad("9", 6, '0', Fmt.Align.Right);		"000009"
Fmt.Pad("9", 6, '0', Fmt.Align.Left);		"900000"
Fmt.Pad("9", 6, '_', Fmt.Align.Right);		"_____9"
Fmt.Pad("99999", 3, '0', Fmt.Align.Right);	"99999"
</pre>

<h3> Lex </h3>

You must have a <A href="rw.html">Rd.T</A> object to use the 
Lex interface, because it gets
its characters from that object. You can use Lex to read data from
the Rd.T into variables of basic types, or you can read TEXT's that
obey certain restrictions. Here are some examples:

<pre>
Lex procedure				Result (assuming no exception)
--------------				------------------------------
b := Lex.Bool(rd);			b set to TRUE or FALSE
i := Lex.Int(rd);			i set to some integer
w := Lex.Unsigned(rd);			w set to some Word.T
t := Lex.Scan(rd, 			t set to TEXT containing longest 
	      SET OF CHAR{'a', 'b'});	prefix of a's and b's in rd 
Lex.Skip(rd, Lex.Blanks);		rd is advanced past leading blanks
Lex.Match(rd, "IMPORT");		rd is advanced past the string IMPORT
</pre>

<h3> Scan </h3>
The Scan interface differs from Lex in that it requires a TEXT rather
than a Rd.T for an argument and it only supports reading basic data
types from a TEXT, like this:

<pre>
Scan procedure				Result (assuming no exception)
--------------				------------------------------
b := Scan.Bool("TRUE");			b set to TRUE
i := Scan.Int("88");			i set to 88
w := Scan.Unsigned("a00");		w set to hex value a00
</pre>
