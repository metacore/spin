<h1> Readers and Writers </h1>

The Rd.T and Wr.T object types are the basis of a heirarchy of 
objects for reading from and writing to terminals, files, 
sockets, text strings and some devices. You can use a Rd.T or Wr.T through
several interfaces. The simplest is IO.i3 which allows you to
specify an optional Rd.T or Wr.T argument for most of its 
procedures. If you need finer control over your I/O, you can
use the Rd.i3 and Wr.i3 interfaces.
<p>
A Rd.T or Wr.T object is
usually locked and unlocked on every procedure call in those 
interfaces. If you want to control locking on your own, you can
achieve higher I/O speeds by calling the procedures in the 
UnsafeRd.i3 and UnsafeWr.i3 interfaces.

<p>
The major derived classes of Rd.T and Wr.T are:
<dl>
<dt> TextRd.T and TextWr.T
<dd> These classes read from and write to TEXT objects. So for example,
	you could use a TextWr.T object to collect output from a thread
	and then decide later whether to print out the whole thing or
	ignore it.
<p>
<dt> FileRd.T and FileWr.T
<dd> Defined in the user/fs/fscore extension, these classes read from
	and write to files. They ought to work with any of our 
	filesystems.
<p>
<dt> ConnRW.RdT and ConnRW.WrT
<dd> These classes read from and write to sockets. In order to
	create such a reader or writer, you must first create
	a socket connection. Then call ConnRW.NewRd() or 
	ConnRW.NewWr() to get the reader or writer object. These
	classes are defined in the 
	<A href="../../../user/socketRW/doc/index.html">socketRW</A> extension.
<p>
<dt> CharDevRd.T and CharDevWr.T
<dd> These classes are defined in the user/dev/devcore extension
	for reading from and writing to character devices.
</dl>

<p> 
The SRC programmers have included exhaustive documentation
in their Rd.i3 and Wr.i3 interfaces which is repeated below.

<h2> The Rd interface </h2>

 An "Rd.T" (or ``reader'') is a character input stream.  The basic
   operation on a reader is "GetChar", which returns the source
   character at the ``current position'' and advances the current
   position by one.  Some readers are ``seekable'', which means that
   they also allow setting the current position anywhere in the
   source.  For example, readers from random access files are
   seekable; readers from terminals and sequential files are not.
<p>
   Some readers are ``intermittent'', which means that the source of
   the reader trickles in rather than being available to the
   implementation all at once.  For example, the input stream from an
   interactive terminal is intermittent.  An intermittent reader is
   never seekable.
<p>
   Abstractly, a reader "rd" consists of
<pre>
| len(rd)           `the number of source characters`
| src(rd)           `a sequence of length "len(rd)+1"`
| cur(rd)           `an integer in the range "[0..len(rd)]"`
| avail(rd)         `an integer in the range "[cur(rd)..len(rd)+1]"`
| closed(rd)        `a boolean`
| seekable(rd)      `a boolean`
| intermittent(rd)  `a boolean`
</pre>
   These values are not necessarily directly represented in the data
   fields of a reader object.  In particular, for an intermittent
   reader, "len(rd)" may be unknown to the implementation.  But in
   principle the values determine the state of the reader.
<p>
   The sequence "src(rd)" is zero-based: "src(rd)[i]" is valid for "i"
   from 0 to "len(rd"). The first "len(rd)" elements of "src" are the
   characters that are the source of the reader.  The final element is
   a special value "eof" used to represent end-of-file.  The value
   "eof" is not a character.
<p>
   The value of "cur(rd)" is the index in "src(rd)" of the next
   character to be returned by "GetChar", unless "cur(rd) = len(rd)",
   in which case a call to "GetChar" will raise the exception
   "EndOfFile".
<p>
   The value of "avail(rd)" is important for intermittent readers: the
   elements whose indexes in "src(rd)" are in the range
   "[cur(rd)..avail(rd)-1]" are available to the implementation and
   can be read by clients without blocking.  If the client tries to
   read further, the implementation will block waiting for the other
   characters.  If "rd" is not intermittent, then "avail(rd)" is equal
   to "len(rd)+1".  If "rd" is intermittent, then "avail(rd)" can
   increase asynchronously, although the procedures in this interface
   are atomic with respect to such increases.
<p>
   The definitions above encompass readers with infinite sources.  If
   "rd" is such a reader, then "len(rd)" and "len(rd)+1" are both
   infinity, and there is no final "eof" value.
<p>
   Every reader is a monitor; that is, it contains an internal lock
   that is acquired and held for each operation in this interface, so
   that concurrent operations will appear atomic.  For faster,
   unmonitored access, see the "UnsafeRd" interface.
<p>
   If you are implementing a long-lived reader class, such as a pipe 
   or TCP stream, the index of the reader may eventually overflow, 
   causing the program to crash with a bounds fault.  We recommend
   that you provide an operation to reset the reader index, which the
   client can call periodically. 
<p>
 Since there are many classes of readers, there are many ways that a
   reader can break---for example, the connection to a terminal can be
   broken, the disk can signal a read error, etc.  All problems of
   this sort are reported by raising the exception "Failure".  The
   documentation of a reader class should specify what failures the
   class can raise and how they are encoded in the argument to
   "Failure".
<p>
   Illegal operations cause a checked runtime error. 
<p>
 Many operations on a reader can wait indefinitely.  For example,
   "GetChar" can wait if the user is not typing. In general these waits
   are alertable, so each procedure that might wait includes
   "Thread.Alerted" in its "RAISES" clause. 
<p>
 Notice that on an intermittent reader, "EOF" can block. For example, if
   there are no characters buffered in a terminal reader, "EOF" must wait
   until the user types one before it can determine whether he typed the
   special key signalling end-of-file. If you are using "EOF" in an
   interactive input loop, the right sequence of operations is:
   <ol> 
   <li> prompt the user;
   <li> call "EOF", which probably waits on user input;
   <li> presuming that "EOF" returned "FALSE", read the user's input.
   </ol>

<h2> The Wr interface </h2>

 A "Wr.T" (or ``writer'') is a character output stream.  The basic
   operation on a writer is "PutChar", which extends a writer's
   character sequence by one character. Some writers (called
   ``seekable writers'') also allow overwriting in the middle of the
   sequence.  For example, writers to random access files are
   seekable, but writers to terminals and sequential files are not.
<p>
   Writers can be (and usually are) buffered. This means that
   operations on the writer don't immediately affect the underlying
   target of the writer, but are saved up and performed later.  For
   example, a writer to a disk file is not likely to update the disk
   after each character.
<p>
   Abstractly, a writer "wr" consists of:
<pre>
| len(wr)       `a non-negative integer`
| c(wr)         `a character sequence of length "len(wr)"`
| cur(wr)       `an integer in the range "[0..len(wr)]"`
| target(wr)    `a character sequence`
| closed(wr)    `a boolean`
| seekable(wr)  `a boolean`
| buffered(wr)  `a boolean`
</pre>
   These values are generally not directly represented in the data
   fields of a writer object, but in principle they determine the
   state of the writer.
<p>
   The sequence "c(wr)" is zero-based: "c(wr)[i]" is valid for "i"
   from 0 through "len(wr)-1".  The value of "cur(wr)" is the index of
   the character in "c(wr)" that will be replaced or appended by the
   next call to "PutChar".  If "wr" is not seekable, then "cur(wr)" is
   always equal to "len(wr)", since in this case all writing happens
   at the end.
<p>
   The difference between "c(wr)" and "target(wr)" reflects the
   buffering: if "wr" is not buffered, then "target(wr)" is updated to
   equal "c(wr)" after every operation; if "wr" is buffered, then
   updates to "target(wr)" can be delayed.  For example, in a writer
   to a file, "target(wr)" is the actual sequence of characters on the
   disk; in a writer to a terminal, "target(wr)" is the sequence of
   characters that have actually been transmitted.  (This sequence may
   not exist in any data structure, but it still exists abstractly.)
<p>
   If "wr" is buffered, then the assignment "target(wr) := c(wr)" can
   happen asynchronously at any time, although the procedures in this
   interface are atomic with respect to such assignments.
<p>
   Every writer is a monitor; that is, it contains an internal lock
   that is acquired and held for each operation in this interface, so
   that concurrent operations will appear atomic.  For faster,
   unmonitored access, see the "UnsafeWr" interface.
<p>
   If you are implementing a long-lived writer class, such as a pipe
   or TCP stream, the index of the writer may eventually overflow,
   causing the program to crash with a bounds fault.  We recommend
   that you provide an operation to reset the writer index, which the
   client can call periodically.
<p>
   It is useful to specify the effect of several of the procedures in
   this interface in terms of the action "PutC(wr, ch)", which outputs
   the character "ch" to the writer "wr":
<pre>
| PutC(wr, ch) =
|   IF closed(wr) THEN `Cause checked runtime error` END;
|   IF cur(wr) = len(wr) THEN
|     `Extend "c(wr)" by one character, incrementing "len(wr)"`
|   END;
|   c(wr)[cur(wr)] := ch;
|   INC(cur(wr));
</pre>
   "PutC" is used only in specifying the interface; it is not a real
   procedure. 
<p>
 Since there are many classes of writers, there are many ways that a
   writer can break---for example, the network can go down, the disk
   can fill up, etc.  All problems of this sort are reported by
   raising the exception "Failure".  The documentation of each writer
   class should specify what failures the class can raise and how they
   are encoded in the argument to "Failure".
<p>
   Illegal operations (for example, writing to a closed writer) cause
   checked runtime errors. 

<p>
 Many operations on a writer can wait indefinitely.  For example,
   "PutChar" can wait if the user has suspended output to his
   terminal.  These waits can be alertable, so each procedure that
   might wait includes "Thread.Alerted" in its raises clause. 

<p>
 Flush "wr", release any resources associated with "wr", and set
   "closed(wr) := TRUE".  The documentation for a procedure that
   creates a writer should specify what resources are released when
   the writer is closed.  This leaves "closed(wr)" equal to "TRUE"
   even if it raises an exception, and is a no-op if "wr" is closed.
