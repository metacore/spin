See matcd.c for Edit History

	These are the I/O port mapping offsets and bit assignments used
	by Creative Labs in their implementation of the host interface for
	the Matsushita CD-ROM drive.  These may be different in the adapter
	cards (including sound cards) made by other vendors.
	It is unknown if the Creative interface is based on a reference design
	provided by Matsushita (other interface vendors would similar or
	identical if this was the case).

	The drive is actually capable of some things that the Creative
	interface doesn't implement, such as DMA and interrupts.

	See matcd.h for defines related to the Matsushita drive itself.
