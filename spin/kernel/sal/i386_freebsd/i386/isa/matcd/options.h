/*	AUTOHUNT	Adds extra code that allows the driver to search
			for interface cards rather than having to hard-code
			the locations in the kernel conf file.
			Leaving AUTOHUNT enabled is the recommended setting.
*/

#define AUTOHUNT


/*	NUMCTRLRS	Configures support for between one and four
			host interfaces, for up to 16 drives.
			The number of entries in the kernel config
			file is used by default, but this may be changed
			to a specific value if desired.

			Leaving NUMCTRLRS based on NMATCD is the
			recommended setting.

/*	FULLDRIVER	If not set, the audio, non-data functions and
			some error recovery functions are eliminated from
			the compiled driver.  The resulting driver will be
			smaller and may help a kernel fit on a boot floppy.
			Leaving FULLDRIVER enabled is the recommended setting.
*/

/*	RESETONBOOT	causes the driver to reset the drive(s) to be
			reset during probing.  This causes any audio
			playback to be aborted and the drives will close
			their trays if they are open.
			Leaving RESETONBOOT enabled is the recommended setting.
*/

#define RESETONBOOT


/*<15>	LOCKDRIVE	If enabled, when a drive is opened using a
<15>			minor number greater than 127, the drive door is
<15>			locked.  The drive door remains locked until all
<23>			partitions on the drive are closed.  The EJECT,
<23>			ALLOW and PREVENT ioctls are refused when this locking
<23>			mechanism is active.
<15>			The additional code size is small so enabling
<15>			LOCKDRIVE is the recommended setting.
*/

/*<5>	FREE2		If enabled, the changes are inserted so this
<5>			module will compile in the world of FreeBSD 2.x.
<5>			Without this, it is known to work in
<14>			FreeBSD 1.1.5.1.   FREE2 should be set automatically

/*<14>	KRYTEN		This enables a bug that someone might consider
<14>			to be a feature.  If KRYTEN is enabled and you are
<14>			playing audio and you issue the resume-play ioctl,
<14>			the audio will stutter, playing the same quarter
<14>			of a second or so of audio several times before
<14>			resuming normally.  Resuming from a pause acts
<14>			normally regardless of the setting of this flag.
<14>			Leaving KRYTEN disabled is the recommended setting.

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This structure contains the hints for where we should look for the
	host adapter.  If you want to change where we search or reduce the
	places we search to avoid confusing some other device, either
	specify explicit addresses in the kernel config file (preferred)
	or change this array.

	If the kernel config file has multiple ? entries, the probe routines
	will use this table multiple times and will eliminate each failed
	entry that probe tries.

	WARNING:  The number of controller entries for this driver in config
	must be less than or equal to the number of hints if hints are used.

	If you add entries to the table, add them immediately before
	the -1 end-of-table marker.  The values already present are
	the ones used by Creative Labs boards and those of a few
	other vendors.

	Each additional entry increases the boot time by four seconds,
	and can increase the chance of accessing some other device.
	Therefore, the list should be kept to a minimum.  Once the
	devices have been correctly located, the kernel should be
	configured so that it looks only at the correct location from
	that point on.

	Be sure to search devices located below 0x3ff BEFORE scanning
	higher locations.  Some boards don't decode all I/O address lines,
	so 0x230 and 0x630 appear identical.

/*	DEBUGSLEEP	If enabled, reports on timeouts, wakeups, dropped
			threads, etc.

			calls and operations.  You might have to enable
			DEBUGCMD as well to get enough debugging information.

/*	DEBUGPROBE	If enabled, reports on the process of locating
			adapters and drives.  The debugging in matcdprobe()
			and matcdattach() routines is enabled with this
			flag.
*/

/*#define 	DEBUGPROBE*/


/*	DIAGPORT	If enabled, additional code is added to send
			debugging state to a debug port.   This should
			not be enabled in production.  The value
			can be set to 0x80 or 0x302, depending on what
			type of debugging board you own.  The global variable
			diagloop is used to make looping reports on these
			devices.

			Some other drivers (and possibly the kernel) fiddle
			with the 0x80 debug port, so it may not be usable
			for isolating failures that result in a kernel panic.
			The 0x302 debug board is recommended in these cases.
			It also displays a word of data, so you get more
			detail.

<10>			It was discovered the 0x302 board was getting set
<10>			into a strange state by the probes for other
<10>			devices.  To resolve this, the display control port
<10>			(0x300) is reset in our probe and open routines.
<10>			DO NOT use DIAGPORT 0x302 if an adapter is present
<10>			at that address.  It could ruin the EEPROM settings
<10>			on the device.
