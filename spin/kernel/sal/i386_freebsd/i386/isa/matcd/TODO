Things to do for the matcd driver			4-Jul-95

1.	Someone wants to switch all drivers from disklabel and
	its assorted mechanisms over to disk slicing and its mechanisms,
	but I was unable to find any useful documentation on how to 
	implement the changes for a read-only, single-partition,
	removable (ie, partition can change size) device.
	So this will have to wait until after 2.1.

2.	Support for reading R-W subcodes while playing audio.  This would be
	useful if you have any CD+G or CD+MIDI discs, but the demand for this
	is pretty low, unless you like Karaoke.  Someone will also have to
	write a CD+G viewer for X.  The code for the driver to add this is
	pretty minor but there aren't any precedents on how to handle the
	data transfer to the application.

3.	Support for reading the ISBN and UPC labels.   The ioctl structures
	for these appear to be defined but no other driver seems to do this.

4.	Multi-session support.  There are two forms of this; what
	Philips defined and what Kodak uses.  This will be quite
	complicated and will probably require changes in the filesystem
	layer.   The drive support for Kodak multi-session is known to work.

5.	Multiple data tracks.  My vision here was to add an ioctl
	that caused a track offset to be inserted into block requests,
	effectively shifting the base to the specified track.  Very
	easy to add but not a big deal since I have only two discs
	in my collection that have multiple data tracks and I mastered
	one of them.

6.	A curses-based CD-Player app (ie, not X).  I will probably do this
	mainly for its value as a debugging tool.  It was pretty annoying
	not finding a single application that actually issued all the
	defined ioctls, let alone any new ones.

If you feel the urge to work on one or more of these remaining items,
please contact the author first at    bsdmail@nemesis.lonestar.org
to make sure the work hasn't already been done or started.
