 *     and what to write into the configuration register
 * [3] move pcic-specific code into a separate module.

 * Device driver for IBM PCMCIA Credit Card Adapter for Ethernet,

 * Based on the Device driver for National Semiconductor DS8390 ethernet
 * adapters by David Greenman.  Modifications for PCMCIA by Keith Moore.
 * Adapted for FreeBSD 1.1.5 by Jordan Hubbard.
 *
 * Currently supports only the IBM Credit Card Adapter for Ethernet, but
 * could probably work with other PCMCIA cards also, if it were modified
 * to get the locations of the PCMCIA configuration option register (COR)
 * by parsing the configuration tuples, rather than by hard-coding in
 * the value expected by IBM's card.
