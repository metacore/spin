/* "superscsi" pseudo device.
 * "superscsi" supports general SCSI utilities that can iterate
 * over all SCSI targets, including those without device entry
 * points.
 *
 * "superscsi" supports the SCIOCADDR ioctl to change the BUS, ID, LUN
 * of the target so that you can get to all devices.  The only thing
 * you can do to "superscsi" is open it, set the target, perform ioctl
 * calls, and close it.
 *
 * Keep "superscsi" protected: you can drive a truck through the
 * security hole if you don't.
