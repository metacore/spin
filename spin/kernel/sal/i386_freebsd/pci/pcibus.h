**
**	The following functions are provided by the pci bios.
**	They are used only by the pci configuration.
**
**	pcibus_setup():
**		Probes for a pci system.
**		Sets pci_maxdevice and pci_mechanism.
**
**	pcibus_tag():
**		Creates a handle for pci configuration space access.
**		This handle is given to the read/write functions.
**
**	pcibus_ftag():
**		Creates a modified handle.
**
**	pcibus_read():
**		Read a long word from the pci configuration space.
**		Requires a tag (from pcitag) and the register
**		number (should be a long word alligned one).
**
**	pcibus_write():
**		Writes a long word to the pci configuration space.
**		Requires a tag (from pcitag), the register number
**		(should be a long word alligned one), and a value.
**
**	pcibus_regirq():
**		Register an interupt handler for a pci device.
**		Requires a tag (from pcitag), the register number
**		(should be a long word alligned one), and a value.
