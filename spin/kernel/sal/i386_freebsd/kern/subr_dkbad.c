 * Internalize the bad sector table.
 * TODO:
 *	o Fix types.
 *	  Type long should be daddr_t since we compare with blkno's.
 *	  Sentinel -1 should be ((daddr_t)-1).
 *	o Can remove explicit test for sentinel if it is a positive
 *	  (unsigned or not) value larger than all possible blkno's.
 *	o Check that the table is sorted.
 *	o Use faster searches.
 *	o Use the internal table in wddump().
 *	o Don't duplicate so much code.
 *	o Do all bad block handing in a driver-independent file.
 *	o Remove limit of 126 spare sectors.
