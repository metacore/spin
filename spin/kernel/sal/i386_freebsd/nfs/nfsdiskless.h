/*
 * Structure that must be initialized for a diskless nfs client.
 * This structure is used by nfs_mountroot() to set up the root and swap
 * vnodes plus do a partial ifconfig(8) and route(8) so that the critical net
 * interface can communicate with the server.
 * The primary bootstrap is expected to fill in the appropriate fields before
 * starting the kernel. Whether or not the swap area is nfs mounted is determined
 * by the value in swdevt[0]. (equal to NODEV --> swap over nfs)
 * Currently only works for AF_INET protocols.
 * NB: All fields are stored in net byte order to avoid hassles with
 * client/server byte ordering differences.
