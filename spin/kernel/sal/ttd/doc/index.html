<h1>TTD Debugger</h1>
Topaz Tele-Debugger. <br>

See the <a href=../../../../doc/Debug/index.html> Debug Page </a> for
debugging procedures and m3gdbtdd usage.

<p>
TTD is an net based remote-end for gdb.  Its client is m3gdbttd
which makes remote-procedure calls (RPCs) to TTD over the network.

<h3>Initialization</h3>

TTD can operate as soon as the
<a href=../../standalone/net/doc/index.html>
SAL polling networking
</a> is ready.
When the net interface is up and the target knows its IP address,
<a href=../../standalone/miscsupport.c> standalone/miscsupport.c </a>
calls ttd_init().  The ttd_init routine just initializes some global ttd state.
<p>
If the <b>-t</b> (for ttd) boot flag was passes on the boot command line,
ttd will stop at this point in a polling loop waiting for gdb to connect over the
net. Otherwise the SAL calls run_program() to start the SAL client.
