<h2>Getting Started</h2>

User-level SPIN applications can be written in any programming language.
They execute in separate address spaces protected "by the hardware".
There are three ways you can write user-level programs for SPIN.  These
methods differ primarily in how user-level programs interact with the 
kernel.  Each has its advantages and disadvantages.

<h4><a href="../user/sphinx/doc/index.html">Sphinx</a></h4>

Sphinx is a UNIX service written as an in-kernel extension.
It can run OSF/1 binaries(either statically or dynamically linked) on
Alpha, and FreeBSD binaries(statically linked) on x86.

<p>
Alpha version is more mature than x86 version, and we are now able to
run nontrivial applications including many X clients on Alpha. On x86,
only helloworld works.

<p>
However, lots of features are still missing. There is no uid/gid mechanism;
character device control is very weak(especially signals). 

<p>
Sphinx provides some features not present in other UNIX systems. Those include
profiling control and add-on systemcall
extension support. The doc is in Yaz's mind only. Bug him. 

<h4><a href="../user/mach/doc/index.html">OSF/1 Unix Server</a></h4>

The OSF/1 Server layers Unix functionality on the SPIN kernel.  It is
based on a Mach emulation, which is constructed in a set of SPIN dynamically
linked extensions.  The OSF/1 Server provides binary compatibility with
DEC OSF/1 3.2 executables.  In addition, it is fairly easy for programmers
to build their own programs which run on the OSF/1 Unix server.  The Mach
emulation extensions also support multi-threaded progams through the 
CThreads interface.
<p>
The OSF/1 Server is a complicated piece of code.  It arguably stresses 
SPIN services harder than any other application.  For this reason, it is
not as stable as Dlib.  It will continue to evolve as the SPIN kernel
evolves.  At this point, it can be booted into single-user mode, where
it can run simple OSF/1 3.2 programs.

<h4>Do it yourself</h4>

You are not required to use one of Sphinx or the OSF/1 server to run
user-level programs on SPIN.  The SPIN 
<a href="../user/shell/doc/index.html">shell</a> has an <b>exec</b>
command which allow programs to be run in a user-level address
space.

<p>
The easiest way for user-level programs to interact with the kernel is
through <i>system calls</i>.  By default, SPIN handles a very small
number of system calls via <a href="../user/usyscall/doc/index.html">
usyscall</a> service(usyscall has to be loaded beforehand by typing
<code>nanny touch USyscall</code> from the shell).

<p>
Sphinx and the Mach/OSF Server emulations provide
handlers for additional system calls.  Users can specify kernel routines 
for new system calls by installing a handler on the <b>MachineTrap.Syscall</b>
event.  <a href="../local/sieg/doc/index.html">SIEG</a> is a tool which 
simplifies writing system call handlers and transferring data across the 
user-kernel boundary. Sphinx systemcall interface and
<a href="../user/trans/doc/index.html">transaction</a> systemcall interface
are written using SIEG.

<p>
The primary advantage to building your user-level program from scratch
is that you can fine-tune user-kernel interaction to the needs of your
application.  For instance, you could optimize argument marshalling to
pass small record datatypes through argument registers.  The primary 
disadvantage is that you have to work out many machine-dependent details
which are already worked out in Sphinx, SIEG, and Unix server.

<h2>Conventions</h2>

<h4>Reflecting Errors and Exceptions to User-Level Programs</h4>

Both Sphinx and the OSF/1 server emulation have adopted UNIX conventions
for passing error conditions from the kernel to the user.  Each system
call has both a return value and an error code.  The return value is
visible to the caller and can be used for a variety of purposes.  By
convention, a negative return value signals an error.

<ul>
  <li> 
On the alpha,
this return value is passed from the kernel to the user via the return
register, <b>v0</b>.  The error code is a bit more tricky, and its
implementation details are typically hidden from the user.  A nonzero
error code indicates an error condition.  On the Alpha, it is passed
from the kernel to the user via register <b>a3</b>.  System call stubs
generated on the user side usually place this error code into the
global variable <b>errno</b>.  If this register is not 0, the system
call stubs will often interpret the result as an error, regardless of
the value in register <b>v0</b>.

  <li> On x86, <code>eax</code> is used as return value reg.
       <code>cflag</code> is set when error happens, and 
       <code>edx</code> is set to hold the <code>errno</code>.
</ul>

<ul> 
<pre> 
int fd; extern int errno;

if ((fd = open("/etc/passwd", O_RDWR, 0)) < 0) {
	/* ERROR! */
	printf("Error! errno = %d\n", errno);
} else {
	printf("File open. fd = %d\n", fd);
}
</pre>
</ul>

<p>

SPIN also allows programs to react to specify low-level reaction to 
faults in user-space.  For instance, an application can install an
handler on the 
<a href="../kernel/spincore/src/machine/ALPHA_SPIN/MachineTrap.m3">Access Violation</a>
 event.  Then, if the application attempts an illegal memory access, the 
handler will be notified and it can perform application specific duties to 
clean up the fault.
<p>
Because of the flexibility SPIN offers, clients can define arbitrary
mechanisms for communicating error conditions between their extensions
and user-level programs.  Sphinx and the OSF/1 extensions have adopted
the UNIX approach for compatibility with existing UNIX applications.
