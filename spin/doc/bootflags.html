<h1>Boot flags and PROM commands</h1>


<H2>Network boot</H2>

The alpha boot PROMs support the bootp and mop network boot protocols.
We use bootp to boot spin with bootpd and tftpd running on silk.
The TFTP server exports a root filesystem
starting with /afs/cs/project.  Filenames that you specify to the TFTP
server are then resolved against that root. For example,
/spin/bershad/spin.boot refers to the file
/afs/cs/project/spin/bershad/spin.boot.
<p>
On TURBOCHANNEL alphas use the ez0 device for network boots and on PCI
alphas use the ewa0 device.
<p>
Here are the steps to net boot.
<UL>

<LI> Put a bootable kernel image someplace high into silk's file
system. We usually put a symbolic link from your real kernel image
(for me, that's
/afs/cs/project/spin/bershad/spin/sal/SPIN/spin_kernel.sys). Call the bootable image something short (spin.boot is a good choice).
The reason you have to move spin.boot is that the PROM will take
only very short path names.  


<LI> From the BOOT PROM, type:<br>
<PRE>b -fi "/spin/YOU/spin.boot" ez0<br></pre><br>

<LI> Wait about 30 seconds as the dots go flying by...

</UL>

<H2>Debug boot</H2>

Use the t flag to stop the boot process as soon as ttd debugging is
initialized.  The t stands for TTD.  Use T if you prefer.
The -fl must be <em>after</em> the -fi flag.
<PRE>
b -fi "/spin/YOU/spin.boot" -fl t ez0
</pre>

<H2>Interactive boot</H2>

Interactive booting lets you specify BOTH an image to run and an
initial set of bootflags.

<pre>
b -fl i<br>
>> "what image you want to run"<br>
   spin_kernel boothowto=0xffffffffff<br>
</pre>
