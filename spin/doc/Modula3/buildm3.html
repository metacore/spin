<pre>

I've completed the reorg of the compiler and libraries and managed to get
everything checked in and working.    My version is based on s2-egs-jul14. This
is what I did.  
	cvs checkout -r s2-egs-jul14 spin
	cvs import --all of my compile stuff --
	cvs tag -b s2-bershad-comp
	cvs commit -r s2-bershad-comp 

I've checked things out again, and it seems to work.   Of course, CVS emptor.

This is a long note because it tries to completely describe the structure of
the new compiler, how it works, AND make it clear what you need to do if you
want to work within the context of what it can support with regard to working
from a set of possible libs and compilers.  (our basic problem is that the SRC
distribution assumes that changes to the compiler are not something that people
do, so they tend to hardcode a lot of the relationships between compilers and
libraries).

To use this stuff, I suggest that you:
	first make a complete copy of your tree (just in case).
	checkout my compiler
		cvs checkout -r s2-bershad-comp spin/compiler spin/conf
	update your standard makefiles
		cvs update -r s2-bershad-comp spin/sal spin/sys spin/Makefile
		(the only changes here are to makefiles and m3makefiles; I'm
		assming that cvs will do the right thing w.r.t. diffing, but I
		never totally understand. Becker may know how to do this
		better. The goal is to just get the new makefiles however).

	gmake compiler
		# if you want to make the compiler


	If you only want to make the libs, you can
		cvs checkout -r s2-bershad-comp spin/compiler/libs
		cd spin/compiler
		gmake build_libs

	BUT DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE YOUR OTHER MAKEFILES and M3MAKEFILES
	TO REFLECT THE NEW LOCATION OF THINGS.

I've tried this a bunch of different times with different configurations and it
seems to work... although this stuff is tricky, so you might run into a
problem. Let me know...

YOU DO NOT NEED m3build ON YOUR PATH ANYMORE.  TO BE SAFE, I SUGGEST YOU GET
RID OF IT.  It's better to fail than to bring in nonsense.


WHAT HAPPENED?
---------------
My goal in the reorg was to allow fine-grained control over which pieces 
of the compiler tree you used.  
To this end, things are set up now so that you can
choose to check out and build all, some, or none of the compiler and still get
the rest of your tree to build.

A second goal was to keep from having to use overrides in any of the
m3makefiles directly.

A third goal was to ensure that the full compiler tree, if you did choose to
build it, was part of the release . For 
this, the compiler now includes m3build, quake,
and necessary templates (which people should feel free to update over time; we
will eventually use an ALPHA_SPIN template I imagine).

A final goal was to allow people to easily share libraries and compilers
without having to explicitly compile, check in, and rebuild.

The basic mechanism for doing all of this is a conf directory in the top level
spin. conf presently contains two things:
	link		--> a symbolic link to the export directory that
			    contains whatever compiler facilities you are NOT
			    providing in your own build tree.
	whichexport	--> a shell script that walks your build tree and the
			    link build tree looking for a particular target.

For example, suppose I checkout s2-bershad-comp but do not check out the
compiler arm.  I would then set conf/link to point to
/afs/cs/project/spin/bershad/freeze/spin/export, which (yes, it really does)
contains a complete compiler and lib build that I promise won't change unless
we discover a problem.  The makefiles and m3makefiles will
import m3build, libm3core_sa, etc from there.


This should give you a flavor about what's going on.

Here are some more details about how it works and how to use it.

At the top level, the checked in spin directory now contains:

CVS
	You know what this is.
Makefile
	The master makefile.  This does not build the compiler by default.
	It builds spin_kernel only.  To build the compiler wholesale (assuming
	you've checked it out)
	whatever pieces out
compiler
	Contains
		libs
			libm3core_sa
			m3core_sa
		m3
			the full compiler
		support
			m3build and quake
		templates
			templates for building libs
		
	You can check out any subset of these and the makefiles will "fill in
	the blanks" for what you choose not to build by looking at conf/link
	file.

	You must ALWAYS check out the templates directory if you are going to
	build any part of the compiler tree. (don't worry, if you fail to do
	this, then the build will fail).

	You should always build from the Makefile in compiler (targets
	supported are:
		all
		build_support
		build_libs
			m3core_sa
			libm3_sa
		build_m3
	as there are a few games it has to play with setting up the templates
	and finding the right version of m3build.

	Basically, here's what happens:
		if you check everything out, build_support runs first, which
		will build m3build and quake, installing itself into your
		export tree.  The m3build that gets installed will have
		hardwired into it the path to the templates which are also
		installed under export.  These templates specify that your
		INSTALL_ROOT is your export tree, so that anything that you
		build and ship will go into the export tree that also contains
		the m3build you use.  It will also expect that the libs and
		additional support programs (like m3) will come from your
		export tree.

		Of course, while you are building the stuff in compiler, you're
		screwed since you haven't yet populated your export.
		The Makefile deals with this by specifying a special set of
		templates that distinguish between a USE_ROOT and an
		INSTALL_ROOT. The USE_ROOT is "where to get the compiler and
		libs from when building the compiler."  The INSTALL_ROOT is
		where to put it when you're done.  The templates in compiler
		say that USE_ROOT is /afs/cs/project/spin, which gets you to
		the native m3 compiler. (note that sm3 is now defunct; the spin
		version of the compiler is called m3 as well, which means that
		we don't need anything special in our m3build and templates )

		As long as you build and ship from the compiler Makefile, the
		appropriate templates and INSTALL_ROOTs are defined.  If you
		build directly with m3build and HAVE BORROWED IT FROM SOMEONE
		ELSE AND do an m3ship, then your library will try to ship to
		where their m3build came from. To avoid this, you need to
		be explicit about where the ship should go.
		For example,	
			m3ship -DINSTALL_ROOT=/afs/cs/project/spin/bershad/spin/export
		*** For a very small reason this doesn't work right 
		now though, so
		you can't actually ship anything which didn't get built from
		compiler unless you have built the whole compiler.

		** So if you are "borrowing" someone else's compiler, you can't
		be shipping your stuff into their tree.

	whichexport

		so that, if you try to build the compiler or any of the 
		libraries and what you need is not in your 
		own export tree or link, it will bring

		When you check out spin/Makefile for the first time, you should
		edit the Makefile and set up the init target so that the link

export
	gets filled in with compiler and spin_kernel. Once I fix
	one more problem in the templates, we'll also be able to ship libspin.a
	and we can use the same "mix and match" approach specifying that
	library.
	*** My sense is that we ought to really have a libsal.a, with the
	master kernel build being a squash together of
		libsal.a
		libspin.a
		libm3core_sa.a
		libm3_sa.a
	where you only need to check out the subtree (package)
	that you actually plan to work with, and use the link facility to get
	to the libraries you need, but don't plan to build.  This is not the
	same as using LPATH which uses a search path, since in that case, it's
	very hard to tell what got pulled in. With the link, it's clear what
	you got from where.
	For the next rev, though...

sal
	The usual.
	I changed obj/Makefile so that it uses whichexport to find the right
	libm3core_sa.a and libm3_sa.a.  (it should be clear now that we could
	use the same thing to find the right libspin.a as well).

sys
	The usual.
	Note that there are no overrides necessary in the m3makefile here. If
	you want to use overrides, then put them in sys/src/m3overrides.
	(we invoke m3build from top level with -O, if you want to invoke from
	sys directly, and want to use overrides, then the -O will scan for
	src/m3overrides.

	m3build from HERE is not smart enough to find your libm3core and
	libm3_sa.a if you have it in a different place than m3build. The basic
	reason is that the templates want to look in ONLY ONE PLACE for all
	libraries UNLESS you override them explicitly with an overrides
	statement. (WE do not have this problem when building the libs or the
	compiler because in that case we get all of our libraries from the same
	place; wherever m3build comes from; the issue with the compiler is
	where we ship TO, with libspin.a it's where we import FROM...).

	With some more hacking, I could probably fix up the templates so that
	it looks in more than one place automatically for importing, but I'm
	reluctant to do that since that's what m3overrides is for.

	For example, here's what I put in my sys/src/m3overrides when 
	I want to have my own libm3_sa.a in some scratch space I was using:
		override("libm3_sa", "/playground/bershad/spin/export/lib/m3/pkg/")
	Note that the library name is now libm3_sa and NOT m3_sa.  This also
	means that the import statements from sys/src/m3makefile  now say:
		import ("m3core_sa")
		import ("libm3_sa"

	
	
user
	the usual

spindle:
	the usual

	NOTE: I DID NOT MAKE CHANGES TO spindle. If you are using non standard
	libraries then you will need to add your own m3overrides to each src
	directory and invoke m3build with -O.
	(it's easy to have -O be the default; let me know if we want this; I
	tend to put the m3build invocations in makefiles however, so I can't
	forget how to invoke them).


Some questions:

Did you change any standard tools?
-----------------------------------

	I had to make a few changes to m3build in order to allow you
	to put packages in different places than where you get them from.
	The primary problem was that command line arguments passed to quake
	were being parsed AFTER you read scripts from the templates directory.
	So, if you said:
		m3build -DFOO=bar
	FOO would not get set to bar until AFTER the templates directory was
	read.  This made it tough to override behavior from the command line
	(note that you could do this all with an m3overrides file, but that
	made it necessary to cons up one of these files even if all you wanted
	to do was redefine a flag; a judgement call...)

	Arguments for quake are now defined in order as:
		quake <All "unknown m3build arguments"> templates overrides
	(before it was:
		quake templates overrides <All "unknown m3build arguments"> 
	which made it hard to override from the command line!)

	Unfortunately, there is one problem with this new ordering. If you want
	to override a variable in templates or in your m3overrides file, you
	can't.  We need support in m3build to specify before args and after
	args. I won't add this until someone says "I can't do this because..."
	

I'm confused about all the templates directories.  Help!
--------------------------------------------------------
	Yes. I agree. There are too many templates directories, but you
	shouldn't need to worry about them unless you need to make changes.
	Here's the story:
		compiler/support/m3build/templates
			- contains the templates that get shipped when you
			build the support code. This is the "default" template
			set you will use whenever you invoke the m3build which
			you ship.

		.../spin/export/lib/m3/pkg/m3build/templates
			This is what actually gets read in when you run an
			m3build from .../spin/export/bin/m3build

		compiler/templates
			This is what gets used to build libm3core_sa, libm3_sa
			and m3.  The primary point of these is to allow you to
			SHIP to a different directory from which you obtain 
			your m3 support.

Overrides, -Dflags, templates?  When do I use what?
---------------------------------------------------
	In general, when you are IMPORTING m3 libraries, you should use
	m3overrides to control which ones you get.

	When you are exporting m3core and libm3, you should use the special
	override INSTALL_ROOT with the special templates from compiler.


Why is this all so complicated?
--------------------------------
	As I said, the compiler infrastructure is not really set up to support
	combined compiler AND code modifications.  Compiler modifications need
	to be isolated just like code modifications.  
	
	In addition, being able to ALWAYS get yourself bootstrapped into a
	working m3, and libs, required a teeny amount of additional mechanism.
	However, it's now pretty hard to get yourself to the point where you've
	toasted your compiler to the point of not being able to build a new
	one.



Have fun...
