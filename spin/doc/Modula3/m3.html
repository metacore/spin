<h1>Using Modula-3 for SPIN</br></h1>

Web pages available on the net are
<A href="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/modula-3/html/home.html">
the SRC M3
</a>
home page and another good page in Europe I can't find right now.
<P>

The man pages just point to the 
<A href="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/modula-3/html/srcm3.html">
SRC implementation
</a>
pages but nevertheless
are in /usr/contrib/man (add that to your MANPATH). 
<p>

In the current release, m3 is only intended to be run by <A
HREF="../../local/m3support/doc/m3build.html">m3build</A>.  m3build
lives is in /afs/cs/project/spin/bin.  m3 and the installed
packages/libraries are in /afs/cs/project/spin/lib/m3.  When you do a complete system build, you get your own.

<p>
NOTE: The compile in /afs/cs/project/spin/bin is a pristine DEC SRC Modula-3
compiler. It does not contain the local changes that we have made to support
SPIN. The local spin compiler can be found in
/afs/cs/project/spin/build/latest/export/bin/.  It's probably quite a task to
just use this compiler all by itself unless you have a whole SPIN tree checked
out.  

<p>
The right thing to is add /afs/cs/project/spin/bin to your path and start by
making a new program and then compiling it.  The pages at SRC explain how to
do this.
