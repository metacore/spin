<P>
It should be unnecessary to allocate untraced data in M3 modules
(though we still do this in a few modules).  Note that safe M3 modules
cannot deallocate these structures with <em> DISPOSE</em>, thereby
consuming system memory without being able reallocate it to another M3
type.
<P>
Another critical point against untraced memory is that for memory
safety reasons it cannot be deallocated once passed to an untrusted
extension.  C and <tt> UNSAFE</tt> m3 code in our system are considered as
trusted modules.  Therefore, passing an untraced memory reference to
these modules is a safe operations as long as it is not deallocated
and subsequently used by the potentially untrusted caller.  Further,
the use of untraced memory even in trusted modules invites the
possibility of memory leaks and unsafe access, and should be
discouraged.
<P>
The bottom line is that the allocation of untraced memory is a
potential source of memory leaks, and the deallocation of it is a
source of breaching memory safety required by the system.
<P>
<H3> Solution</H3>
<P>
Disallow the allocation of untraced memory in safe modules.  This can
be statically enforced by adding the ``NOT Module.IsSafe()''
requirement to the M3 compiler builtin NEW operator for untraced
memory.  A drastic approach is to disable the allocation of untraced
memory in m3 modules, and eventually eliminating the UNTRACED REF type
from the language.  There is no need for the memory dichotomy
introduced by M3, especially when the type header of traced memory can
placed out-of-line.
