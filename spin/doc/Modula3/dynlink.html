<h1>Safe Dynamic Linker Implementation for M3</br></h1>
<date>November 10, 1995</date>
<P>

Extensions are written in Modula-3 and are integrated with the rest of the
kernel via dynamic linking.

<p>
The overall process is conceptually very similar
to static linking. Instead of filenames to specify which pieces of code to
link together, the programmer uses domains to specify which code to combine.
Instead of a Main.m3 that initializes the program, the module bodies (the 
BEGIN ... END block of a module) are used to initialize an
extension. And instead of linking against a system library, the extension
programmer links against the Spin public domains which contain user-accessible
code exported by the system.

<p>
The similarities are slightly misleading, however, in that to keep the
overall process simple for the programmer, a whole bunch of mechanisms
must conspire transparently under the covers. A review of these
mechanisms follows, which explains the terms used in the problems
section.

<h2>Dynamic Linking Basics.</h2>

<p>
The bulk of the dynamic linker is concerned with interpreting COFF
files. The major components of a coff file are <i>sections</i>,
<i>relocations</i>, and <i>symbols</i>.

<p>Sections house data, code and symbols. There are about 15 different
types of sections. There is a
section for text, data, small initialized data, constants,
4, 8-byte and "A" literals, procedure data, BSS, small BSS,
etc. Each section contains some data belonging to the program at
hand. For instance, the text section will contain machine
instructions. However, the instructions will generally not be
complete, since they might depend, for instance, on the location of
the lita section in virtual memory. Until the lita section is assigned
a spot in memory by the linker, the instructions cannot be patched to
working order. The dynamic linker first reads in all the sections, and
assigns each section to some virtual address in memory.

<p><i>Relocations</i> are then used to patch the section contents with
the runtime values that are assigned by the linker. The relocation
language is very powerful - there is even a little stack based
calculation mechanism that allows the calculation of arbitrary
formulas. Each relocation modifies a particular piece of section
data. It also describes what to modify that bit of data to. For
instance, a relocation might say, "put the value on top of the
calculator stack in the low 32 bits of this instruction." Usually,
the relocation will involve a calculation based on the value in the
to-be-patched field. This value is quite often a coff address, which
has to be translated from coff offsets into the virtual location that
now corresponds to that coff offset. The type and class fields in the
relocation entry describe when such translations have to be performed.
Finally, some relocation entries will refer to symbols.

<p>
<i>Symbols</i> allow one to specify a precise location in a coff
section. The generator of the coff file, usually a compiler, assigns a
symbol to reside at a particular section and creates a symbol entry
saying "Procedure X resides at offset 35 in the text segment."
Relocations can then say something like "Patch this lda instruction to
point to symbol X." The dynamic linker then has to look up X, and
subsequently calculate the assigned address of the text segment, and
return the new value for X.

<p>
There are two symbol tables, one for internal use by the coff module
that the symbol appears in (e.g. labels etc. are internal symbols), 
and an external one for use by other coff modules. The 
external symbols are visible by other coff modules (domains), who can
use that symbol to patch their own relocation entries.

<p>
All strings in a coff file are in one large glob, and all
textual names appear as offsets into this string table.

<p>
Caveats: This is a simplified view of what happens. There are some quite
complicated cases, such as a symbol that appears to be exported but is
not, or section types which require one to modify the values of the
symbols found within, that are too lengthy to go into in a primer. The
gp offset calculation deserves a whole treatise on how an innocent
little feature can become a boondoggle.

<h2>M3 linking</h2>

<p>
Once a module has been downloaded and linked into the system, two
things have to happen: (1) the types it has introduced must be 
registered with the runtime, (2) the main bodies of the extension have
to be executed. This is done in a phase in Domain.Initialize. The
types are assigned typecodes and integrated, and some type problems
are detected at this stage. Then the main bodies of the M3 modules in
the extension are executed in collection order.

<A name=errors><h2>Problems with extensions</h2>

<p>
It is necessary to bear in mind that the entire dynamic linker was
written with only an outdated coff spec (which has almost nothing
to do with the extended coff used on alphas and mipses) and a lot of
reverse engineering. It is thanks to a group of persistent extension
writers that the dynamic linker is as robust as it is. M3 type linking
has not had the benefit of either stability (shifting the compiler base from
3.3 to 3.5) or a large number of dynamically linked M3
extensions.

<dt>The dynamic linker does not handle "ld -r" output.
<dd><b>Synopsis:</b> "ld -r" changes the coff addresses of the coff
sections to some pretty unusual values. It also 
reorganizes their layout in memory. The dynamic linker refuses to
link such a file, since some coff offsets become negative.
<dd><b>Work-around:</b> Do not use ld -r. Use gld -r if you really
must do a partial link, or let the new domain interface generate a
(possibly self-extracting) binary for you.
<dd><b>Solution Strategy:</b> I will change the domain templates to not
run ld -r on extensions. This will also eliminate our dependency (and
trust) on gld and ld. This is waiting for spin-6.

<p>
<dt>Subtypes introduced by an extension do not admit NARROW.
<dd><b>Synopsis:</b> NARROW checks are done by doing a range
comparison between assigned typecodes. When a new subtype is
introduced, it needs to get "inserted" into this range, which is not
possible without walking the whole heap and changing every
pre-existing typecode (as well as a whole bunch of other changes).
<dd><b>Work-around:</b> Use a LOOPHOLE temporarily. Type equality
still works.
<dd><b>Solution Strategy:</b> Pardy has implemented a different typecode scheme
where there is a level of indirection in the typecode lookup that
occurs before the range check. This fix is currently being tested.

<p>
<dt>Interface checking is not performed.
<dd><b>Synopsis:</b>Interfaces are not checked to ensure that an
interface Foo that was compiled against is the same interface Foo that
is linked against. This might lead to type and safety errors.
<dd><b>History:</b>This feature used to exist in the 3.3 compiler, but
got dropped in 3.5.
<dd><b>Solution Strategy:</b>We need to reimplement the previous
scheme, which relied on stealing some code from m3linker, and placing
some information in the object files at compile time that m3linker
needs later on.

<p>
<dt>Type consistency checking is not performed.
<dd><b>Synopsis:</b>Revelation consistency is not performed for
dynamically linked code. A revelation may not match a partial
revelation, and the user might not get a warning.
<dd><b>Work-around:</b>Use a "program" directive in the extension 
m3makefile, which will force the m3linker to perform this consistency
check for you at static compile time.
<dd><b>Solution Strategy:</b>The fix for interface checking will take
care of this manifestation of the same problem.

<p>
<dt>Domain destroy does not reclaim any resources 
<dd><b>Synopsis:</b>Domain destroy does not reclaim any resources or
uninstall nameserver handlers.
<dd><b>Solution Strategy:</b>Breaking nameserver bindings requires a 
change to the templates. Implementing reuse of resources from Domain.Destroy 
requires that domains keep track of linkage information (at least). We need a
spec for domain destroy. This item has been low on the queue since it doesn't
directly affect safety or performance, but will pop to the top when the
interface checking is added.
