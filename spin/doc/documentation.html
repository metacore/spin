    Documentation</br></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

Providing clients with informative, well-written documentation is 
instrumental in expanding the popularity of SPIN.  If cavemen cannot
figure out how to write applications for SPIN, they will write applications
for something else.  They may even write entire operating systems for
the Exokernel.

<h2>Structure</h2>

Sections of code are very different.  Some are huge and critical to
the entire system (e.g. 
<a href="../kernel/spincore/src/strands/doc/index.html">Strands</a> or 
<a href="../kernel/spincore/src/dispatch/doc/index.html">Dispatcher</a>), 
while others are small and provide only one service (e.g. 
<a href="../kernel/spincore/src/utils/doc/externref.html">External 
References</a>).  Accordingly, documentation will be very different.
There is no <i>concrete</i> standard on how documentation should be 
formatted.  This <a href="./template.html">template</a> is a rough 
guideline on what kind of information should appear in your documentation.  
The closer we adhere to this standard, the easier it will be to read.

<p>

The SPIN documentation tree is part of the source tree.  This
allows easy referencing of source code and other documentation without
absolute path names (hence, the whole tree can be moved without updating
links!).  <b>Please avoid URLs with absolute pathnames</b> 
(e.g. use ../../src/Foo.i3 rather than file:/afs/cs/project/..../src/Foo.i3)
<b>whenever possible!</b>  Documentation 
is typically contained in a <b>doc</b> directory
underneath or next to the <b>src</b> directory for the code being 
documented.

<h2>Tricks</h2>

<h4>Pathnames</h4>

There has been some interest in providing tools which simplify typing
long relative pathnames.  Several possibilities have been shot down for
varying reasons.  These include:
<ul>
<li><b>Filtering:</b>  Run a script over .html files which changes all
    occurrences of e.g. FULLTREE with the absolute pathname to the top
    of the source tree.  The problem is what to do with filtered files.
    Create whole new copies?  What happens if a filtered file accidentally
    gets checked in?</li>
<li><b>Directory of Links:</b>  Have a flat directory at the top level
    with links to all other files.  The problem is that no two files
    represented in the link directory could have the same name.</li>
<li><b>Links in Each Doc Directory:</b>  Put a link to the top of the
    source tree in each <b>doc</b> directory.  This would eliminate
    climbing up the tree with relative path names.  The problem is that
    adding links to CVS is no trivial matter.  A potential solution is
    to insert links in the build process (i.e. the documentation writer
    instruments the subdir Makefile to place a link to the toplevel in
    the doc directory).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pretty Printing</h4>

SRC has a few tools which beautify Modula-3 code.  At this time, the 
simplest to use is <b>m3totex</b>, which combined with <b>latex2html</b>
can produce html code.  (More info to come on using these.  In the
meantime, this <a href="./Example.i3">sample</a> .i3 file illustrates the
Modula-3 coding style which <b>m3totex</b> assumes.)  In my humble 
opinion, these tools are more trouble than they are worth.  The 
<a href="../kernel/spincore/src/dispatch/doc/index.html">Dispatcher</a>
documentation is a good example of incorporating code into documentation
without any fancy tools.

<h2>Exporting Documentation</h2>

Occasionally it may be nice to extract documentation from the <i>SPIN</i>
source tree and create a free-standing documentation tree.  A tool to
extract documentation is the Perl script <tt>/spin/bin/docexport.pl</tt>.
<tt>docexport.pl</tt> copies all HTML files in <tt>doc</tt> directories
from a <i>SPIN</i> source tree to a new directory.  <tt>docexport.pl</tt>
will also copy any source files linked to from these HTML files, as well
as pictures in <tt>/projects/spin/www/pics</tt> and papers in 
<tt>/projects/spin/www/papers</tt>.  The idea is to create a hierarchy
of HTML files and supplementary files that is as self-contained as possible.
<p>
<tt>docexport.pl</tt> has several command-line options to control the 
documentation export:
<ul>
<li><b>-dir <doc dir>:</b> directory in which to place the new 
    documentation tree.  The default is <tt>./SPINDocs</tt></li>
<li><b>-source <source dir>:</b> SPIN source directory from which to
    get docs.  This should be a top-level <tt>spin</tt> directory.  The
    default is the potato: <tt>/afs/cs/project/spin/build/merge/spin</tt>.</li>
<li><b>-nosrcfiles:</b> disallow the export of <tt>.m3</tt> and <tt>.c</tt>
    files.  The default is to allow <tt>.m3</tt> and <tt>.c</tt> files.</li>
<li><b>-exturl:</b> allow references to external URLs (e.g. the Modula-3 
    home page at SRC).  The default is to not allow external URLs.</li>
<li><b>-q:</b> quiet mode.  This will cause bad URL and other messages not
    to be displayed.  The default is not quiet.</li>
<li><b>-h:</b> print a message describing the command-line options.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<tt>docexport.pl</tt> has some limitations and features in parsing HTML:
<ul>
<li>It cannot yet parse references which span multiple lines.  e.g.
<pre>
    Click &lt;a
    href="../../foo/doc/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information.
</pre>
    This is unfortunate and largely a function of my poor Perl skills.
    It is on the queue to be fixed.</li>
<li><tt>docexport.pl</tt> can be told to ignore entire HTML files as well
    as sections of certain files.  In order to ignore an entire HTML file,
    place the following comment at the top:
<pre>
    &lt;!-- SPIN DOC EXPORT IGNORE --&gt;
</pre>
    In order to ignore a section of an HTML file, bracket the section 
    with lines which have these comments:
<pre>
    &lt;!-- SPIN DOC EXPORT SECTION IGNORE START --&gt;

    ... (ignored text) ...

    &lt;!-- SPIN DOC EXPORT SECTION IGNORE END --&gt;
</pre>
    This technique is crude, but I wrote it quickly and I wanted it to
    be blatantly obvious what was going on.  To see an example of its
    use, view the source of <a href="./index.html">spin/doc/index.html</a>.  
    The release notes and CVS notes are ignored because they are dependent 
    on too many local <tt>file:</tt> links.</li>
<li>Pages which use latex2html icons pointing to the CSE Department
    default (http://www.cs.washington.edu/general/latex2html_icons/...)
    will be switched to use icons in the <i>SPIN</i> documentation tree.
    This makes the documentation more self-contained, and improves the
    presentation of documents when external URLs are not allowed.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, <tt>docexport.pl</tt> cannot be run reliably on only
    a subdirectory of <i>SPIN</i> documentation (e.g. to test you 
    documentation to make sure it is parseable).  Many documentation files
    use relative paths that assume the presence of the entire source 
    directory structure.</li>
<li><tt>docexport.pl</tt> will parse <i>all</i> HTML files under <i>all</i> 
    <tt>doc</tt> directories in the soruce tree.  It performs no 
    reachability tests before parsing an HTML files.  Thus, even if the 
    link to an HTML file is explicitly ignored, or if the file is obsolete
    and no longer pointed to, it will be parsed and errors will be reported.
    This is okay, because if the file is unreachable than the errors will
    not be noticed in the exported documentation, but it's still annoying.
    The solution for obsolete files is to remove them from the tree!
