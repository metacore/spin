<h1> What to do when things don't work </h1>

Yes, yes, we know you've read the cvs web page, and the cvs faq, and you've
for sure done everything you were supposed to, but you're still having trouble
checking out, committing, updating or merging through CVS.  So, you've come
here, to the CVS WOE page, to learn what's going wrong.

<h2> Help. cvs update doesn't work. </h2>

Reminder. You use cvs update when you want to bring your branch up to date with
someone else's tag, or with the main repository. To bring up to date with the
main repository, type:
<pre>
cd <top of your spin tree>
cvs update
</pre>

<p>
to update with someone else's branch, or an intermediate tag named,
some-branch, you would type:
<pre>
cd <top of your spin tree>
cvs update -j some-branch
</pre>

<h3> CVS is complaining that it can't find the CVS directory under sal</h3>

In all likelihood, you have forgotten to unimport all that sal crap before you
<pre>
gmake unimport
</pre>
from the top of your spin tree.

<h3> CVS is telling me that sal files are not in my branch.</h3>
For example, you might see something like:
<pre>
Merging differences between 1.3 and 1.3.20.1 into files
cvs update: Updating sal/data
cvs update: file ace_data.c only in revision s6-mef-s7-1
cvs update: file autoconf_data.c only in revision s6-mef-s7-1
cvs update: file bt_data.c only in revision s6-mef-s7-1
cvs update: file cons_sw_data.c only in revision s6-mef-s7-1
cvs update: file eisa_option_data.c only in revision s6-mef-s7-1
cvs update: file fb_data.c only in revision s6-mef-s7-1
</pre>

Curious as you are, you even check what the status of those files are in the
named branch with
<pre>
cvs stat sal/data/bt_data.c
</pre>
and you get back nothing.
<p>
In all likelihood, the person who made the tag failed to do the unimport before
they tagged. Even though those files are not part of the repository, they can
be found in the Attic (since they at one time were part of the repository).
CVS, in it's wisdom, decides that the files should be part of the tree, somehow
and sort of, but not entirely, and then yells at other people who try to update
based on that tree.  Of course, the person who performed the tag thinks
everything is hunky dorey.

<h3> CVS is telling me that a file which I know doesn't exist anymore exists in
the update tag </h3>

Neither CVS nor us are very good at keeping track of files that we've removed,
and so the result is that deleted files often reappear in the repository and in
intermediate branches. Just as a reminder, to delete a file:
<pre>
rm file
cvs remove file
cvs commit file
</pre>
It's as simple as that!
<p>
If the file is not removed properly, it will continue to reappear.  Don't
worry, just complain to the mergemaster and to the person who was responsible
for removing the file originally.
