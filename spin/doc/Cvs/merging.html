</h1>


A merge takes all of the changes done by everyone in the group and
combines them into a single new release.  We try to merge as often as
possible (minimally, once a week) to keep people from working in
branches that diverge too far from one another.  Each week, someone
new is appointed mergemaster and is responsible for coordinating the
new merge.  Merges typically happen on Friday morning and are
intended to be ready by Friday around noon.  

<H2>The role of the mergemaster (MM) </H2>

MM has several responsibilities:

<DL>
<DT> Determining what goes into the merge.  
<DD> An MM will only put into a merge tags that have been tested,
committed, and properly submitted through the merge procedure. Proper
submission is described below.  

<DT> Creating a buildable, bootable system.
<DD> The MM will take each tag and merge it against successively
advanced branches off of the mainline.  With each tag, the MM is
counseled to ensure that the merge results in a buildable, bootable
system.  Tags that come equipped with code that tests new features, or
exercise old ones, should work.

<DT> Coordinating the organization of the
 documentation describing the features, bugs, and fixes in the current
release.
<DD> Each release comes with a set of "how to use" pages that describe
how to checkout, build, and boot the system. Most releases follow a
boilerplate pattern. It is the MM's job to collect this information
together.  Submitters should ensure that this goes smoothly by clearly
describing their contributions in pages that become part of the merge.


<DT> Announcing the new release
<DD> The MM will announce the new release to the group.

</DL>

The MM may find it useful to deputize a Co-MM to help debug the distribution.


<H2>Procedures for merging</H2>

Merging is a two-way street.  People submitting tags for the merge
need to follow a couple of simple procedures to ensure that their tags
make it into the new merge with a minimal of effort, and ensure that
their tag, once merged, cna be easily tested by the MM.  In return,
the MM will take care to collect the files from each tag and merge
them into a new release.

<H3>Flakey Tags</H3>

<P>
At the MM's discretion, tags that appear flakey, inadequately
documented, create complex conflicts, do not build, or result in a
build that does not work, may not be included in a merge.  If you
submit a branch like this, and it's rejected by the MM, you've got to
try the following week to get your branch accepted by correcting
whatever wasn't right on the previous submission. You could also
create an accelerated release with just your stuff added into what the
MM was able to collect and release that.
<P>

<H3>Submitting a tag</H3>

To submit a tag for merging, follow the normal CVS procedures for
creating a tag and then document your tag following these steps:
<UL>
<LI> Go to the build web area's upcoming directory under
/projects/spin/www/internal/howto/Build/upcoming.  

<LI> Copy the standard
<A HREF="file:/afs/cs/project/spin/www/Internal/howto/Build/templates/newtag-template.html">newtag
template (newtag-template.html)</A> from that directory into a file of
your own. For example, Bershad would 
<pre>cp ../templates/newtag-template.html bershad.html</pre>

<LI> Edit your new tag file, taking care to fill in all of the
subsections.  While there is no fixed format to this file, if you can
avoid changing the format, please do. This will make the merger's job
easier.  If you think there are items which need to be in the
newtag-template file, please discuss it with the group before making
any changes.  If your page is getting a little long, create your own
subdirectory in the upcoming directory and put additional pages there.
Documentation pages (for example, describing new shell commands)
should go in your new directory.

<LI> If your new tags requires that the merge run any special programs
or tests, make your own subdirectory under the upcoming directory and
include the scripts that run those tests there. In your new tag page,
include a discussion of how to run those scripts and what the output
should be.


<LI> Add your tags page to the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/internal/howto/Build/upcoming/tags.html">upcoming
tags page</A>.

</UL>


<H3>Collecting tags</H3>

Here are the steps the MM will follow in creating the merge:

<OL> 

<LI> Announce to the group that a merge has started by sending out
mail message to <A HREF="mailto:spin-m3@cs">spin-m3</a>, and marking the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/internal/howto/Build/upcoming/tags.html">upcoming
page</A> in the build area as closed.


<LI> Visit the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/internal/howto/Build/upcoming/tags.html">upcoming
page</A> in the build area to determine what tags people have decided
should go into the upcoming merge.  This file contains pointers to
HTML pages in the upcoming directory which describe the contents of
each submitted tag.


<LI> Review each submitted tag page to ensure that it contains all of
the necessary information about each new tag.  If you have any
questions about the tag, send mail to the submitter and try to get an
answer before you finish your merge.


<LI> Start merging.  The easiest way to do this is to check out the
trunk, and then apply each tag in succession against your checked out
trunk. For example, suppose the latest trunk version is spin-X, and you want
to merge in bershad-spin-X and mef-spin-X to make a new trunk version spin-Y:
<pre>
cvs checkout -r spin-X spin	# get the latest
cvs update -A spin		# gt rid of sticky-magic-tags and move to trunk
cvs update -j spin-X -j bershad-spin-X # merge new code onto trunk
# build and test, if all works, continue. If it doesn't work, back out.
# DAVID B !??! HOW TO BACK OUT??
#
# 
# Tag and commit current intermediate branch.
cvs commit -m "bershad-spin-X spin-X" spin
cvs tag spin-X-bershad spin

#
# Each new tag generates its own intermediate branch
cvs update -j spin-X-bershad -j mef-spin-X # merge new code onto trunk

</pre>

<p>

At any point, you can back out of the merge to a previous tag.  This
should help with debugging and in determining where interactions are
causing failure.  It also gives you a snapshot that you can hand back
to a submitter that will let them work with you to determine where a
failing conflict has occurred.

<LI> After you merged a tag and conclude that the tag will make it
into the new release, modify the tag's HTML file provided by the
submitter to reflect its new status.  Also, modify the upcoming.html
page to reflect that the tag has been accepted.


<LI> Once you've merged all of the tags, go to a fresh build area,
checkout, and try to build from scratch. This should work.  If it
doesn't, either figure out what's wrong and try to fix it (not always
possible without a wizard), or figure out some temporary workaround
that will let people make progress on the new release while a fix to
the configuration is determined.  The configuration fix can be
released subsequently in a special patch tag.

<LI> Create a new directory in the web Build area named after the
current release.  For example, if you are merging spin-10, then create
a /projects/spin/www/internal/howto/Build/spin-10 directory.  The
easiest thing to do is rename the upcoming directory to spin-10 (or
whatever the release is).  In the release directory go these files
(for which templates can be found in the .../Build/templates
directory):

<DL>
<DT> <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/internal/Howto/Build/templates/index.html">index.html</A>.
<DD> The index page containing pointers to more detailed pages.

<DT> <DT> <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/internal/Howto/Build/templates/tags.html">tags.html</A>.
<DD> The tags file that was jointly created by all submitters.

<DT> <DT> <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/internal/Howto/Build/templates/whats-new.html">whats-new.html</A>.
<DD> A page containing a high level description of
the new release.  This information can just be a summary of the
information from each submitted tag page's overview section. This
information should be detailed enough though to enable a caveman to
determine the major points about the new release.

<DT> <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/internal/Howto/Build/templates/checkout.html">checkout.html</A>.
<DD> Information on how to checkout the new release.

<DT> <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/internal/Howto/Build/templates/build.html">build.html</A>.
<DD> Information on how to build.

<DT> <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/internal/Howto/Build/templates/boot.html">boot.html</A>.
<DD> How to boot.

<DT> <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/internal/Howto/Build/templates/bugs.html">bugs.html</A>.
<DD> Major problems. Detailed bug information can be found on each tag
submitter's page.

<DT> <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/internal/Howto/Build/templates/merge-info.html">merge-info.html</A>.
<DD> Information about what happened during the merge. What got
screwed up, what was difficult, what got dropped on the floor,
why... This information will help us refine the merge procedures over
time.  
</DL>


<LI> Export the new merge into the afs build area.
<pre>
David, can you describe the steps required here. Thanks.
</pre>

<LI> Update the build.html page in the .../howto/Build page to contain
a link to the new release.

<LI> Create a new upcoming directory in the web Build area that
contains a newtag-template.html and a tags.html that can be used by
the next merger. 

<LI> Send mail to the <A HREF="mailto:spin-m3@cs">group</A>
 announcing the new release.

</OL>

<H2>What happens after a merge</H2>

After a merge has been announced, it is in everybody's best interests
to get back onto the trunk.  Follow the procedures in the
checkout.html page from the release tree.

<H3>What if my tag didn't make it into the merge?</H3>

Talk to the MM and find out why your code didn't make it in.  Fix
whatever was wrong, and then create a new branch which merges yours
with the trunk.  If your tag is critical, then you can create an
additional release containing only your trunk (in other words, follow
all of the above procedures).  We should try to avoid interim
patches except for configuration stuff.
