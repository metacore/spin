The helpful
<A HREF="cvs-faq">
CVS FAQ
</a>
has lots of hints and
<A HREF="cvs.ps">
Version Management with CVS
</a>
is pretty thorough.
<p>

Here is the
<A href="http://www.winternet.com/~zoo/cvs/">
CVS Web Page
</a>
on the net.
<p>

The man pages are in the
<A HREF="directories.html#ContribManPages">
contrib man page directory
</a>
(add that to your MANPATH).  The info pages are in the
<A HREF="directories.html#ContribInfo">
contrib info directory</a>.
<p>

We
<A href=""
http://www.cs.washington.edu:80/research/projects/spin/www/internal/Notes/Sys/merge.html>
were using 
</a> the
btools package from the OSF ODE system.  We are still using build
technology of the 
<A HREF="ode.html">
OSF ODE system</a>, including build, odemake and mksb.
<p>

cvs is in the
<A HREF="directories.html#ContribBin">
contrib bin directory</a>.
To use cvs put the
<A HREF="directories.html#CvsRoot">
CVS root directory</a>
in your CVSROOT environment variable. 

<h2> Using CVS for Spin files </h2>

See the <A href=""
http://www.cs.washington.edu:80/research/projects/spin/www/internal/Implementation/release.html>
releases page </a> for the list of SPIN revisions.
<p>


<h3> Starting out </h3>
The <A HREF="exception.example">exception.c example</a>.
<p>

Use <samp>cvs checkout -r <em>revision</em> <em>file</em></samp> to get the files
on which you want to work. <em>revision</em> is the full tree you are
backing from (see Revisions above).  <em>file</em> can also be a
directory name which will get all files in the directory tree. Run this in your
<samp><em>sandbox/</em>src</samp> directory giving <em>file</em> as the
relative path from src, as in <samp>mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c</samp>.
<P>


<h3> Making your branch </h3>
First setup a set up a sandbox using mksb.  CVS replaces the btools like
bco, bci and bcs.  We still have sandboxes, shadowing and build from
<A HREF="ode.html"> ODE </a>
which CVS knows nothing about.
<p>
To do RCS-like operations on your files without affecting anyone else,
make your own branch.  The new branch will be a temporary branch that
is merged back into the mainline when the next release is merged.
<p>
Getting a file:
<pre>
	cd becker/work/src
	cvs checkout -r release-4 mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c
</pre>
You may now edit, remove, or otherwise mangle the file without affecting
anyone else or the RCS file where it came from
<p>
Committing changes requires you have your own branch:
<pre>
	cvs tag -b r4-becker mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c
	cvs update -r r4-becker mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c
</pre>
By convention make branch names like <samp>r4-becker</samp>  where r4
corresponds to the release from which your files were checked out.
<p>
Now you can procede with an edit/commit cycle in your own branch.
<pre>
	edit
	cvs commit -m "rcs log message"  mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c
	edit
	cvs commit -m "rcs log message"  mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c
	...
</pre>
	

<p>
Use <samp>cvs stat -v <em>file</em> </samp> to see all the revisions and
branches associated with a particular file.  Revision tags are static unless
you force them to move.  Branch tags always refer to the latest file on
the branch. 
<p>
At merge time, the merger combines everyone's
branching into a new release so understand how merging happens before
getting fancy with branching.


<h3> Adding a new directory </h3>

When a new directory is needed in the src structure, it also needs to be
added to the CVS repository.  Also set the current branch (aka sticky
tag) to the trunk.
<pre>
	mkdir dir
	cvs add dir
	cvs update -A dir
</pre>

<h3> Adding a new file </h3>

To make sure new files go into the next merge, they are added on the
main trunk and then branched.  First, add the new file to the trunk:
<pre>
	create file
	cvs add file
	cvs update -A file
	cvs commit file
</pre>

Then make your own branch just as above:
<pre>
	cvs tag -b r4-becker file
	cvs update -r r4-becker file
</pre>
Now the file can be modified as any other on your branch.


<h3> Removing files </h3>

When a file is to no longer appear in current or future revisions, use
the remove subcommand.  The file will be stored in the "Attic"
subdirectory in the CVS repository so past revisions can still be fully
checked out.

<pre>
	cvs update -A file
	rm file
	cvs remove file
	cvs commit file
</pre>

<h3> Tags versus Branches </h3>

Most cvs operations have a "-r rev" option where rev can be either a
branch or a tag.  Both branches and tags represent RCS labels stored 
in the RCS headers in the repository RCS files.  It is CVS, not RCS, that
intreprets the labels to mean tags or branches.
<p>
A <b>branch is a lineage </b>created by cvs tag -b file
<p>

A <b>tag is a freeze </b> marked by cvs tag file
<p>

Use 'cvs stat -v file' to examine the branches and tags for "file"
stat -v shows these labels for mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c:
<pre>
	r4-loipc                        (branch: 1.3.2)
        release-4                       (revision: 1.3)
        r3-merge                        (revision: 1.3)
        release-3                       (revision: 1.1.1.2)
        release-2                       (revision: 1.1.1.1)
        release-1                       (revision: 1.1.1.1)
        origin-branch                   (branch: 1.1.1)
						.
					       /|\
						|
				"revision:" is a tag.  "branch:" is a branch.
</pre>

Checkout by tag release-3 will retrieve version 1.1.1.2
<pre>
	cvs checkout -r release-3 mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c
</pre>

Checkout from branch r4-loipc will retrieve 1.3.2.x where x is the
latest version on that branch.
<pre>
	cvs checkout -r r4-loipc mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c 
</pre>

<h3> CVS instead of cp to share code</h3>

Rather than copying code between sandboxes with cp, you can use cvs to
merge other code into your branch.  Suppose I make a r4-becker branch for
mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c and commit a new version of trap.c with the
freeze tag of r4-becker-apr1. 
To bring this tag into your branch:
<pre>
	cvs update -j r4-becker-apr1 mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c
</pre>
If there are conflicts, cvs will mark those areas of the file it failed
to resolve with >>>> ==== <<<<< lines.
<p>



<h3> What update and checkout do </h3>
Update and checkout (alias get) are often interchangeable, hence confusing.
They will modify your tree, but never ever delete files that are modified.
Modified (uncommitted) files are reported as "M filename" and are not
deleted.
<p>
<samp>cvs update -r <em>branch</em> </samp> will replace your branch
with <em>branch</em> adding and deleting files to make the tree look
like <em>branch</em>.
<p>
<samp>cvs update -j <em>branch</em> </samp> will merge the diffs between
<em>branch</em> and the trunk into your tree.  Previously modified files are
affectd as well as untouched parts of your branch.
No files will be added or deleted.  When <em>branch</em>
has new files, you must add those files to your branch with tag -b and
update -r as usual.
<p>

<h3> Weirdness </h3>
<dl>
<dt> Ctrl-C
<dd> CVS uses the system(3) call to run the RCS commands so Ctrl-C often
only kills the
subprogram instead of CVS.  Use Ctrl-Z to stop it and then kill CVS
(kill %).
<dt> Path names
<dd> Some commands only work on the current directory (add and release).  
Sometimes you have to give the whole path (mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c) or
can work with partial paths (alpha/trap.c) if a CVS subdir already exists 
the current directory.
<dt> Current branch
<dl> CVS's idea of the current branch for a particular file is affected
by several things.  If it thinks all the files in a dir belong to a
single branch,  new operations will default to that branch.  If it sees
a mixture or no files at all, the default is the head of the main trunk.
The "sticky tag" is the default rev for the -r flag on all the CVS
operations.  Update -r sets the sticky tag, which is reported by stat -v.  
</dl>


<h3> How to merge </h3>
First checkout the previous merge.  Since it is possible for main trunk
commits to have occured, we must merge the head with the old release and
see if any files got screwed up.
In an empty sandbox/src dir
<pre>
	cvs checkout -j release-1 mk osf
</pre>
If the revision labelled release-1 is not the most recent trunk
revision of that file, it will have 'M' or 'C' status and needs to be
examined.  Trunk changes should only be done by the merger.
<p>
For everyone's branch,
<pre>
	cvs update -q -j r1-branchname
</pre>
Clean merges are marked 'M'.  Conflicts you have to resolve are marked 'C'
<p>
Now make the merge compile and run,  committing as desired to the
trunk.  Change conf/version.edit in the server and kernel to the new
version.
<p>

Once the merge works, check it in and label the new release.
<pre>
	cvs commit
	cvs tag release-2
</pre>
