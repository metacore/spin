Eric,

Marc's instructions are good, but ommitted some details of
step 4. In order to add your new code to the potato, you have
to type "cvs add" for each new directory. Then you need to
cd into that directory, and type "cvs add" for all files
within that directory. Then "cvs commit" all the files. You
can use shell expansion to ease the task of checking in files,
and use the -m option to supply a checkin message, e.g. -m 'LFS
checkin'. You have to be in the same directory as the files when
you type "cvs add" for some dumb reason.

Also, please make sure that all files you are checking in
have an appropriate copyright banner with some attribution 
of proper credit. I know you did this for your files, but doing
a pass over Scott's and Tim's files would be great. 

I remember setting the FULLTREE variable in your spin/make.conf
config file to something not standard to be able to bring you
up to date last time we updated. You should probably get a new        
version of make.conf when you do the checkout and discard the
old one.

This should be it. Good luck,
Gun.

Subject: merging lfs code

Eric,

Please let me know when you will have time to merge the LFS code.  I'm
available until 3:30pm today (sunday) and again around 8pm.  We can
meet anytime on Monday to do the merge.

Attached is a rough outline of what you have to do.  Don't hesitate to
contact me if you run into trouble.

Merging your code into the potato.  These instructions assume that
your source code is on the CVS trunk and not a CVS branch.  Stop
reading here if your code isn't in CVS at all.

1) update to the latest potato

cd ~

cvs co -A spin/user >& ~/user.update
#gets the latest stuff from spin/user and redirects output to a file

cvs co -A spin/kernel >& ~/kernel.update
#gets the latest kernel changes and redirects output to a file

Look in the *.update files and resolve all conflicts (look for lines
starting with "C").  Then compile the kernel and user area and test if
your code still works.


2) grab the potato

/spin/bin/cvsjr/grabhotpotato

3) swing your spin symlink over to the potato

cd /spin/ericc
ln -fs /spin/build/hotpotato/spin spin

4) update the potato with your changed code

cd ~/spin && pwd
#you should now be in the potato, since you've updated your symlink

cd ..     
#you are now one directory above potato's spin directory

cvs co -A spin
#This will update the potato to whatever is latest in the cvs trunk,
#which  should only suck in your source code, unless someone else
#committed to the trunk without updating the potato.  
	

Marc
