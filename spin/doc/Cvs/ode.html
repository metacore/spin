Go to these pages for the
<A href=
http://www.cs.washington.edu:80/research/projects/spin/www/internal/Notes/Sys/build.html>
NFS environment.
</a>
The sandboxing
<A href=sb-README>
README
</a>
is also pre-AFS.
<p>

The
<A href=file://localhost/projects/spin/src/ode2.1.1/dug.ps>
Development User Guide
</a>
and
<A href=file://localhost/projects/spin/src/ode2.1.1/sag.ps>
System Administrators Guide
</a>
have more than you want to know about ODE.  They also cover the
versioning part of ODE, called b-tools, that we
<A href=
http://www.cs.washington.edu:80/research/projects/spin/www/internal/Notes/Sys/merge.html>
were using 
</a>
and are getting rid of in
favor of 
<A href=cvs.html>
CVS.
</a>
<p>

The man pages
are in /projects/spin/ode/man (add that to your MANPATH). 
<p>

The ODE tools are included in the build tree.  For a stable binary
directory, add /afs/cs/project/spin/build/latest/export/alpha/bin to
your path.  When modifying the tools, you will want to instead put the bin dir
from your sandbox export tree on the path.
