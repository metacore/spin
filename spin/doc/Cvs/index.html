<A NAME="gettingStarted"><H2>Getting started with CVS</H2>

<DL>

<DT> CVS is in the <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu:80/research/projects/spin/www/internal/howto/directories.html#ContribBin"> contrib
bin directory</a>.
<DD> To use it, make sure you have this directory in your path.

<DT> Also, make sure that you set the <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu:80/research/projects/spin/www/internal/howto/directories.html#CvsRoot">
CVS root directory</a> in your CVSROOT environment variable.
<DD> Not doing this will make most commands fail.

<DT> <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu:80/research/projects/spin/www/internal/howto/directories.html#ContribManPages"> man pages </a>
<DD> The man pages are in the contrib man page directory
(add that to your MANPATH).
</DL>


<A NAME="usingCVS"><h2> Using CVS </h2>

The latest greatest SPIN source tree resides in the CVS trunk. 
The trunk is the version of our files that are checked out by default,
ie. no branch is specified.
But in general, we never get code (checkout) direct from the trunk.
<p>
SPIN development always takes place on branches from the trunk to allow
concurrent development.  Each developer starts out with a private
copy(branch) of the source tree. A branch can be modified without
interfering with any other branch.
At regular intervals all the work in the branches is merged together
to form a new trunk.  

<A NAME="makeBranch"><h3> Making your branch </h3>
The first step in this development environment is creating your own
branch of code on which to work.   Remember to set the environment
variable CVSROOT to <samp>/afs/cs/project/spin/cvsroot</samp>.
Create a branch with a command following this form
<pre>
	cvs rtag -r spin-4 -b s4-becker spin
</pre>
<p>
s4-becker will be the name of this branch (often the name is, confusingly,
called a tag in the cvs docs).  This is the naming convention for branches
<dd> s<em>VersionNumber</em>-<em>User</em>
<p>
Getting your code tree is a seperate step from creating your branch.
This command checks out a tree in the subdir <samp>spin</samp> in the
current directory.
<pre>
	cvs checkout -r s4-becker spin
</pre>
<p>
This is your own tree you can freely change.  Each file is backed by
an RCS file in CVSROOT.  To restore a file to its checked out condition,
remove it and restore it with update.
<pre>
	rm file
	cvs update file
</pre>
<p>
Branches must be created from the new trunk after every merge.
<p>

<A NAME="tagsVsBranches"><h3> Tags versus Branches </h3>

Most cvs operations have a "-r rev" option where rev can be either a
branch or a tag.  Both branches and tags represent RCS labels stored 
in the RCS headers in the repository RCS files.  It is CVS, not RCS, that
intreprets the labels to mean tags or branches.
<p>
A <b>branch is a lineage </b>created by cvs tag -b file
<p>

A <b>tag is a freeze </b> marked by cvs tag file
<p>

Use 'cvs stat -v file' to examine the branches and tags for "file"
stat -v shows these labels for mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c:
<pre>
	r4-loipc                        (branch: 1.3.2)
        release-4                       (revision: 1.3)
        r3-merge                        (revision: 1.3)
        release-3                       (revision: 1.1.1.2)
        release-2                       (revision: 1.1.1.1)
        release-1                       (revision: 1.1.1.1)
        origin-branch                   (branch: 1.1.1)
						.
					       /|\
						|
				"revision:" is a tag.  "branch:" is a branch.
</pre>

Checkout by tag release-3 will retrieve version 1.1.1.2
<pre>
	cvs checkout -r release-3 mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c
</pre>

Checkout from branch r4-loipc will retrieve 1.3.2.x where x is the
latest version on that branch.
<pre>
	cvs checkout -r r4-loipc mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c 
</pre>


<A NAME="distBranch"><h3> Distributing code from your branch </h3>

As frequently as every two days, we may merge the branches into a new
trunk.  To contribute your code to the trunk, or to distribute it to
other branches, it must be commited and tagged. 
<p>
You may commit   to the RCS files in CVSROOT as often as you want.
<samp> cvs commit</samp> corresponds to the RCS ci command.  A commit is a good way to preserve
a file before experimenting with a radical change.  You can always
restore previous versions using <samp>cvs update</samp> as described above.
<p>
In your working directory, commit files with a command of this form
<pre>
	cvs commit -m "log message" files/dirs
</pre>
You can commit individual files or entire directories.  Directories are
committed recursively unless you use the -R flag.
The message goes into the $Log: index.html,v $
The message goes into the Revision 1.2  1996/09/13 22:39:16  rgrimm
The message goes into the Fixed links.
The message goes into the
The message goes into the Revision 1.1  1996/06/11 21:44:51  bershad
The message goes into the New doc structure.
The message goes into the area and RCS log of each file commited.
If the message is omitted, commit will start an editor so you can enter
the log message.
Read log messages with <samp>cvs log file</samp>.
<p>
In the top direcotry, make a tag with a command of this form
<pre>
	cvs tag s4-becker-apr1 spin
</pre>
The tag command puts a label in every RCS file to identify the
revision that corresponds with the file in your branch.
<p>
When your branch is committed and tagged, advertise that tag to the
merger or others interested in picking up your code.


<A NAME="updateAndCheckout"><h3> What update and checkout do </h3>
Update and checkout (alias get) are often interchangeable, hence confusing.
They will modify your tree, but never ever delete files that are modified.
Modified (uncommitted) files are reported as "M filename" and are not
deleted.
<p>
<samp>cvs update -r <em>branch</em> </samp> will replace your branch
with <em>branch</em> adding and deleting files to make the tree look
like <em>branch</em>.
<p>
<samp>cvs update -j <em>branch</em> </samp> will merge the diffs between
<em>branch</em> and the trunk into your tree.  Previously modified files are
affectd as well as untouched parts of your branch.
No files will be added or deleted.  When <em>branch</em>
has new files, you must add those files to your branch with tag -b and
update -r as usual.
<p>

<p>
if you want your file to be updated from the trunk type "cvs upd <file-name>"
if you want to update it and move it back from your current branch 
to the trunk type "cvs upd -A <filename>"
you do not have to remove the file to do it

<A NAME="shortcuts"><h3> Shortcuts </h3>

The SPIN tree is large so whole tree commands can take 15 minutes.
To save time, you can apply the commands discussed so far to just the
code subtrees
your are interested in, such as only sal and sys.  In particular the gdb
part of the tree is very large and often untouched.
<p>
One option for major subtrees, is to branch and checkout everything, then
<samp>rm -rf subtree</samp>.  Then cvs commands will ignore that subtree.
<p>
Working on subtrees can speed up cvs ops but there are caveats.
Be sure you, and anyone you hand tags to, knows you are not working
on a complete tree.
<p>
Doing cvs operations after the fact on parts of the tree you did not
expect to change can be very time consuming and frustrating.
A good way to stay aware of the CVS status of your branch is with this
command
<pre>
	cvs update -q dirs
</pre>
The update command will report files in <em>dirs</em> that cvs does not
know about and report the modifications that have not been commited.
The list it generates displays these code characters next to the filenames.
<dd>M Modified and not commited.
<dd>A Added and not commited.
<dd>R Removed and not commited.
<dd>? New unknown file.  Possibly needs to be added.
<p>

<A NAME="addingNewFiles"><h3> Adding new files </h3>

To add a new file to the cvs system, first create the file.  Then
add it to the trunk with this sequence
<pre>
	create file
	cvs add file
	cvs update -A file
	cvs commit file
</pre>
And add the new file to your branch 
<pre>
	cvs tag -b s4-becker file
	cvs update -r s4-becker file
</pre>
Other people can add the new file to their branch the same way
<pre>
	cvs rtag -b s4-savage spin/path/file
	cvs update -r s4-savage file
</pre>


<A NAME="addingNewDirectories"><h3> Adding new directories </h3>
Add a new directory with these commands
<pre>
	mkdir dir
	cvs add dir
	cvs update -A dir
</pre>

<A NAME="removingOldFiles"><h3> Removing obsolete files </h3>
Remove a file from future versions of the trunk with these commands
<pre>
	cvs update -A file
	rm file
	cvs remove file
	cvs commit file
</pre>
The file remains in CVSROOT so older versions of the trunk can be
recreated.  It also remains in the current branches until the next branch off
the next trunk.  To remove files from current branches, use this sequence
<pre>
	cvs tag -d s4-becker file
	cvs update file
</pre>



<A NAME="reorganizingTree"><h3> Reorganizing the tree </h3>

This is CVS's major weakness.  Renaming files or directories, or moving
files around in the tree can be done, but is a pain, and is not for the
faint of heart.  At merge time,
when no branches exist, in CVSROOT <strong>copy</strong> the RCS files from the old name or
location to the new name.  Use the normal cvs remove commands to delete
the file with old name.

<A NAME="mergingTagsIntoYourBranch"><h3> Merging Tags into Your Branch </h3>

Merging is best left to the merger who creates new trunks, but on
occasion you just can't wait.
It is important to
keep track of what tags you have merged into your branch and tell the
merger what tags you have picked up.
The simplest scenario is where you never
distributed a tag or merged any tags into your branch. 
More complex scenarios
require careful tracking of who has merged what where.
File adds and removes must also be tracked by hand.
<p>
Suppose you want to merge s4-becker-apr1 into your branch.  Further you
know that s4-becker-apr1 has had no other tags merged into it and you
have not merged anything else into your branch.  Merge with a command of
this form
<pre>
	cvs update -j spin-4 -j s4-becker-apr1 spin
</pre>
The update -j (for join) applies the diffs it finds between spin-4 and
s4-becker-apr1 to all the files in the spin tree.  The actual merging
is done with rcsmerge and diff3.
<p>
Now suppose s4-becker-apr15 is announced and you need to again merge it
into your branch.  Merge with a command of this form
<pre>
	cvs update -j s4-becker-apr1 -j s4-becker-apr15 spin
</pre>
This will merge into your code only the differences between the april 1 tag
and the april 15 tag.  This avoids applying the spin-4 to april1 mods
yet again.  Those would be duplicate changes/conflicts and you would have
to go edit the conflicts out.
<p>
When you have modified a patch of code yourself and then merge someone
elses change to that same code, a conflict results the automatic tools
cannot resolve.  Both versions of that patch of code will appear in the
merged file marked with banner lines like this
<pre>
	<<<<<<< filename
	your existing version of code segment
	=======
	version form the tag being merged (tag happens to be version 1.7 of filename)
	>>>>>>> 1.7
</pre>
Search for the banner lines with grep and resolve them by hand.


<A NAME="weirdness><h3> Weirdness </h3>
<dl>
<dt> Ctrl-C
<dd> CVS uses the system(3) call to run the RCS commands so Ctrl-C often
only kills the
subprogram instead of CVS.  Use Ctrl-Z to stop it and then kill CVS
(kill %).
<dt> Path names
<dd> Some commands only work on the current directory (add and release).  
Sometimes you have to give the whole path (mk/kernel/alpha/trap.c) or
can work with partial paths (alpha/trap.c) if a CVS subdir already exists 
the current directory.
<dt> Current branch
<dl> CVS's idea of the current branch for a particular file is affected
by several things.  If it thinks all the files in a dir belong to a
single branch,  new operations will default to that branch.  If it sees
a mixture or no files at all, the default is the head of the main trunk.
The "sticky tag" is the default rev for the -r flag on all the CVS
operations.  Update -r sets the sticky tag, which is reported by stat -v.  
</dl>
