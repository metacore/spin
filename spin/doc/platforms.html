<H2>Platforms</H2>

SPIN currently supports two target architectures: ALPHA_SPIN and
IX86_SPIN.  Each of these is referred to as BASETARGET in the
Makefiles.

Under an architecture XX, several platforms may be supported.
These are:

<dl>

<dt> XX_PROF
<dd> <A HREF="../kernel/spincore/src/utils/doc/profile.html">Profiling</A>

<dt> XX_REF
<dd> Reference counting

<dt> XX_PROF_REF
<dd> Profiled, with reference counting

<dt> XX_HACK
<dd> Intended for hacking

</dl>

The binaries for a platform are placed in a directory named after the
platform.  The binaries for each of these platforms is different;
therefore, having multiple platforms allows us to better manage
different binary trees.  If you want to use XX_HACK, you'll have to go
in and modify some critical files:

<dl>

<dt> m3build templates
<dd> modify local/m3support/m3build/templates/XX_HACK to call the
 compiler with the appropriate arguments

<dt> kernel configuration
<dd> modify kernel/sal/BASETARGET/conf/XX_HACK to create the kernel
with the correct configuration

</dl>
