<h2><i>SPIN</i> Documentation Template</h2>

This file is a possible template to use in writing documentation for
a <i>SPIN</i> extension or service.  The topics included are just 
ideas -- they can be expanded or pruned where appropriate.

<hr>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

Why have this service? What are its goals? What services are
provided to meet these goals? Why is the SPIN version of this service
different from any other OS?

<h3>Overview</h3>

Where does this service fit into SPIN? Is it a core service?
Extension? Language feature? Library?
<p>
What is the basic design? What important algorithms or data
structures are used? Code snippets or pointers may be appropriate
here. In addition, some low-level details may be of interest. For
instance, the strand documentation can mention RAS regions and
FastLists.

<h3>Using the service</h3>

What are the interfaces provided? (once again, code snippets or
pointers may be appropriate). If there is more than one interface,
what purpose does each serve? (e.g. Sched as opposed to Strand as
opposed to ThreadExtra). 
<p>
An example of how to use the interface may help out. For instance,
how would a dispatcher client install a handler on the syscall event?
<p>
The service might require some build or link instructions. For
instance, dlib and the Unix server documentation will need to contain
more than descriptions of interfaces.
<p>
Finally, some services, like Strands and Plexus, are specifically
designed to be extended. Instructions, caveats, and examples may be
appropriate. 

<h3>Remaining Issues</h3>

Where does this design or implementation fall short? Which features
are designed but not yet implemented? What features have not yet been
designed, but will be added in future work?
