Click <a href="http://velvet.cs.washington.edu:8080/gnats-bin/wwwgnats.pl">here</a> for the <i>SPIN</i>
problem report management system (<code>PRMS</code>).  The goal of the
<i>SPIN</i> <code>PRMS</code> is to address the problem of organizing
the large amount of problem reports by defining a database made up
entirely of messages filed automatically by electronic mail.

<p>The database itself is an ordered repository for problem reports
(<i>PRs</i>). Each PR, sent in by the submitter, receives a unique
<i>PR number</i> which identifies it throughout its lifetime.  Upon
receipt of the problem report, <code>PRMS</code> will automatically
respond to the submitter indicating receipt with assignment of a
number unique to the problem report.  Submitters can send large files,
if necessary, to reproduce the problem; <code>PRMS</code> keeps track
of them.  <code>PRMS</code> will keep the submitter up to date on what
changes are made to the PR, when and why the change was made.  All
parties involved in a PR are notified of state changes.
<code>PRMS</code> will notify the submitter of any errors made in
submitting problems for unsupported software applications.  An
improperly submitted PR will be placed into a pending state to be
corrected by the PRMS administrator.  Finally, Maintainers' bug fixes
do not close out the bug report until the submitter confirms that
their problem is really handled.

<p>The following figure shows the different states a PR goes through
before being closed.
