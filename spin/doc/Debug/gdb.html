<A NAME="overview"><h2> The Big Picture</h2></A>

SPIN and Mach support an ethernet debugging protocol called TTD (name
explained below) that allows you to debug a running kernel or
user-level program over the network.  The TTD-enabled debugger,
combined with a kernel that speaks the TTD protocol will let you:
<ul>
<li> use GDB to symbolically debug a remote kernel,
<li> examine all threads and address spaces,
<li> maintain and switch between symbols for multiple
non-overlapping address spaces,
<li> partially debug overlapping address spaces,
<li> set and recover from breakpoints in either kernel space or user space,
<li> forcefully HALT a wedged kernel in nearly all cases,
<li> look at either Modula-3 or C code.
<li> debug dynamically linked code.
</ul>

TTD should not be confused with rcons-gdb, which was our original
debugger that mapped gdb's remote target commands onto the Mach
kernel's ddb interface.  This implementation, although incredibly
useful, had lots of drawbacks (reliability, required that the kernel
keep all of its symbol tables, required long-term support for ddb,
etc.)  

Very soon, we should be able to compile our kernel's without MACH_KDB
support built in.  TTD does not require that the target machine
maintain symbol table information.

<A NAME="history"><h2> History </h2></A>

TTD stands for "Topaz Teledebugging Protocol."  TTD was originally
designed by Dave Redell at DEC SRC for use with the Firefly
workstations and Topaz operating system.  Several years later, Rob
Malan, then at CMU, did a port of TTD to the Intel 386.  Several years
after that, the SPIN project implemented a version of TTD for the
Mach/SPIN kernel on the Alphas (you're reading about this now). We
also modified a version of GDB (gdb4.13) so that it understood a TTD
host as a potential debug target.

<A NAME="intro"><h2> Using GDB with TTD </h2></A>

To use GDB to debug a kernel running Mach or SPIN, or to debug a
user-space applicaton on such a kernel, you need:

<ul>

<li> A version of gdb that understands TTD as a target.  The latest
release always has a copy of m3gdbttd and you can use it.

<li> A version of the target kernel compiled with debugging symbols.
You get this by default.

<li> A version of the program running in any target address spaces
that you wish to debug.

<li> An understanding of debugging with gdb.  Click <A
HREF="http://www.ns.utk.edu/gnu/gdb/gdb_toc.html">here</a> for a
tutorial.

</ul>

<h3>Basic concepts</h3>

There is very little that is different between debugging a kernel over
the network and debugging a regular program with gdb.  Two machines
are involved with kernel debugging. The <b>target</b> machine is the
machine which you want to debug. The <b>debugger</b> machine is the
machine from which you are debugging.
<p>
To debug a target, you need to start up a version of gdb that
understands ttd targets.  I'll assume you've found such a program.  For
sake of example, let's assume that we want to debug the machine
spincycle, which is running a version of the SPIN kernel 
living in the directory: /afs/cs/project/spin/bershad/spin/sal/SPIN

We'll want to specify as the target executable the complete path, as
the relative source file names embedded in the executable only make
sense when resolved against that complete path.
<p>
Start up gdb:
<pre>
m3gdbttd /afs/cs/project/spin/bershad/spin/sal/SPIN/spin_kernel.sys
</pre>
After a few seconds, we should get the gdb prompt.   
<pre>
(gdb)
</pre>
<p>
We need to tell gdb to use spincycle as a target:
<pre>
(gdb) target ttd spincycle
</pre>
<p>

This will cause gdb to attempt to establish contact with the target
host. If all goes well, you should see something like this (with questions
you'll need to answer):

<pre>
(gdb) target ttd spincycle
Attaching to remote machine across net...
Attached to spincycle, an ALPHA
Connected to MK
target not stopped: stop it? (y or n) y
ttd_intr ()
    at ../ttd/alpha/ttd_interface.c:190

Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
[Switching to (0xfffffc000063b5a0 0xfffffc0000631468) [a-thr]]
gimmeabreak () at locore.as:1750
locore.as:1750: No such file or directory.
(gdb) 
</pre>

The way to interpret this is: "we're attaching to spincycle, which is
an ALPHA.  The target was not presently stopped when we connected, so
we asked it to stop.  After stopping the target, the current active
thread/task pair were (0xfffffc000063b5a0 0xfffffc0000631468), and we
found ourselves stopped at gimmeabreak().  The gimmeabreak() function
is where you will often find yourself as a result of a forced stop.
If, for some reason (like your kernel crashed, or was being debugged
by someone else), the target was already stopped, and you'll be asked
if you indeed wish to connect.

<p>

At this point, the target is stopped and waiting to be controlled.
You can look at kernel variables, get a backtrace, set breakpoints,
etc.  To continue, type "cont." At any time, while the target is
running, you can interrupt it with ctrl-C, and you'll find yourself
back in gimmebreak().

<A NAME="threads"><h2> Threads </h2></A>

A remote kernel has many threads. GDB will let you walk from thread to
thread, examining stack traces, looking at local variables, etc.  GDB
and TTD use their own thread naming convention, so the names used by
spin_mk for threads and tasks (thread_t, task_t) are not directly
usable by you when manipulating threads.

<p> 
A thread is named by a unique non-negative integer.  TTD enforces
a simple naming convention that makes it easy for you to figure out
which threads are part of which address space.  Each of the n address
spaces (tasks) on the target is assigned a number from 0 to n-1, and
each of the t threads in each address space is assigned a number of 0
to t-1. The name of a specific global thread is simply (task number *
1000) + (thread number).  For example, thread 3 in task 2 is named
2003.  As a result, all threads in a single task have similar names.
<p>
It used to be that we used m3gdbttd to debug the spin+mach kernel with the DEC OSF/1 unix server. In that case, we had some special task numbers:
<ul>
<li> Task 0 (all threads with name < 1000) is the kernel.
<li> Task 1 (all threads with 1000 <= name < 2000) is the default pager.
<li> Task 2 (all threads with 2000 <= name < 3000) is the UNIX server.
</ul>

But, presently, we can't guarantee that you'll get these nice numbers
when debugging any of the server code.


<h3> Looking at threads </h3>

GDB only learns about new threads on the target when you tell it
to. By default, when you connect, the only thread GDB knows about is
the current one. To kickstart the thread machinery, you need to say:
<pre>
(gdb) thread sweep
</pre>
This will enumerate all threads, showing you:
<pre>
thread_name (thread_t  task_t) [a-thr] last_pc
</pre>

Where the thread_t and task_t listed are those of the target's
internal names for the specific thread.  You don't use these names
when manipulating threads through gdb, although you can use them when
looking at the target's data structures for a given thread.  The
current thread will be marked with a *:

<pre>
...
* 1 (0x0 0x0) [TAZ[k]e]ttd_intr () at ../ttd/alpha/ttd_interface.c:190
  2 (0x0 0x0) [TAZ[k]e]16_fffffc000034b4e4 in Strand__Block (

...
</pre>

<h3>Commands that manipulate threads</h3>
<p>
Here are some useful commands for dealing with threads:
<dl>
<dt>thread sweep
<dd>probes the target for all known threads

<dt>info thread
<dd>lists all threads that gdb currently knows about

<dt>thread thread_num
<dd>switch the current thread to the named thread.  

<dd> NOT PRESENTLY WORKING... The builtin gdb symbols
$thread, $kthread, $ktask refer to the current gdb thread number, the target's representation for that thread (as a thread_t), and the target's representation for that thread's address space (task_t).  
For example, you can say
<pre>
thread 2001
print *$kthread
</pre>
and you'll see what the target thinks is currently the status of thread 2001.

<dt>thread apply <thread list> command
<dd>applies the named command the the list of threads.
<dd>Threads are named by an identifier X, where 
X / 1000 is the number of the task (in old ddb
fashion), and X mod 1000 is the number of the thread in that task.
For example, thread 2005 is the fifth thread in task 2.  (the
unix server).
<dd> A useful command is
<pre>
thread apply 2000-2099 backtrace
</pre>
which will list the complete set of stacks for all threads (assuming there are 
less than 100) in the unix server.
You can look at all thread stacks with "thread apply all backtrace" This is occasionally useful.

</dl>

<A NAME="breakpoints"><h2>Breakpoints</h2></A>
<p>

You can set breakpoints in the target. When you set a breakpoint, the
breakpoint will be set in the current thread's address space.  If you
want to set a breakpoint only for a particular thread, you should use
a conditional breakpoint switched off of the particular thread you are
interested in.


<A NAME="gdb-domains"><h2>Debugging multiple symbol namespaces with domains</h2></A>

The original gdb only allowed you to debug using one exec file at a
time. gdb-ttd lets you load multiple exec files at once. Symbols and
values can be resolved against any union of loaded exec files.  This
feature lets you seamlessly debug, say, both the spin_mk kernel and a
user-space application together.
<p>

A single exec-file is stored in a "domain."  You can have as many
domains loaded at a time as you want. Domains are named and stacked,
and symbols and values are resolved against the stack of loaded
domains in LIFO order.  By default, you get one domain, which contains
the initial exec file, when gdb starts up.  You can create more
domains, load symbol files into them, and manipulate the domain stack
to influence gdb's mappings of names and addresses.

<dl>
<dt> domain stack
<dd> shows you current stack of domains.
The stack is listed with the bottommost element being the "top of the
stack" and tagged with a *. 

<dt> domain create domain_name
<dd> creates a new domain  and assigns it the specified name. For example:
<pre>
domain create osf
</pre>
will create a new domain called "osf."  The osf domain will be empty (not associated with any symbol table), and will not be on the stack.

<dt> domain push domain_name
<dd> pushes the named domain onto the top of the stack. This will
cause gdb to look in the symbol table for domain_name first when
trying to resolve an address or a symbol.
<dd> If domain_name is omitted, then the push operation will swap the
top two domains.  (In this way, domain stacks work like directory
stacks from csh).

<dt> domain pop 
<dd> pops the topmost domain (effectively removing it
from the search space of symbols which gdb uses to resolve addresses
and names).

<dt> domain sweep 
<dd> This does all the "add-symbol-file" commands automatically.  It
creates and pushes a new domain and then add all the symbols from the
extension objects.  This can be done by hand using the create, push and
add-symbol-file commands manually with date from the spinshell 'show domains' command.

<dt> file filename
<dd> loads the named file into the domain at the top of the stack, destroying any symbol table information currently associated with the topmost domain.

<dt> info domain
<dd> lists all currently loaded domains, which can be a superset of
the domain stack.  That is, if you pop a domain from the stack, the
domain is not destroyed, it just is removed from gdb's currently
active set of symbol tables.  You can push any domain returned by
"info domain" back onto the stack if you like.

</dl>

Here's an example showing how you can use domains to debug the kernel
and the OSF/1 server at the same time. It creates a second domain,
called osf, puts it at the top of the domain stack, and then
loads the domain with the vmunix file for the server.

<pre>
(gdb) domain create osf
(gdb) domain push osf
(gdb) file work/obj/alpha/osf/server/DEFAULT/vmunix.OSFSRV.DEFAULT  
(gdb) domain stack
 Domain default (objfile-name = sal/SPIN/spin_kernel.sys: 0xfffffc00002a0000-0xfffffc0000424910)
*Domain osf (objfile-name = work/obj/alpha/osf/server/DEFAULT/vmunix.OSFSRV1.DEFAULT: 0x220000230-0x2400d5f20)
(gdb) 
</pre>

Now,  gdb will use the union of the symbol tables from the 
server and the kernel to resolve names and addresses.

<h3> Trickyness </h3>

If the same symbol is defined in more than one domain in the stack,
then gdb will use the first one it finds.  This may sometimes not be
the right thing. For example, the symbol "mach_msg_trap" is defined in
both the server and the kernel. If you want a specific instance of a
symbol from a specific domain, then you should take care to place that
domain at the top of the stack beforehand.  Eventually, gdb will let
you qualify individual symbols with domain specifiers, as in
$osf::mach_msg_trap.  Not yet however.


<A NAME="user-stacks"><h2> User space stacks </h2></A>

GDB requires symbol table information on the alpha in order to
determine stack frame formats.  This means that, once you've got a
symbol table for a specific address space loaded in a domain, gdb will
let you look at stack traces that cross the user-kernel boundary. For example,
<pre>
(gdb) where
#0  mach_msg_continue ()
    at /afs/cs/project/spin/build/release-5/src/mk/kernel/ipc/mach_msg.c:1961
#1  0xfffffc0000313910 in mach_msg_continue ()
    at /afs/cs/project/spin/build/release-5/src/src/src/src/src/src/src/mk/user/libcthreads/cthreads.c:586
</pre>
shows a stack trace that crosses the boundary (clearly marked).  


<h4> Interpreting kernel boundary crossings </h4>

There are three different kinds of "boundary" crossings that can be
reflected by a thread which is stopped in the kernel.

<dl>

<dt> Full stops.
<dd> On occasion, a thread will block in the kernel with all of its
state maintained across the block (no continuation). For these "full
stops" you will see a complete backtrace, generally starting with
Swtch_context and ending with (probably) cthread_body out in user
space. Register values at the boundary crossing will be significant. 

<dt> Continuation stops.
<dd> Most of the time, a thread will block in the kernel on a
continuation, for example "mach_msg_continue."  In these cases, the
thread's kernel state at the boundary will be bogus (all registers
save for a few will be zero).

<dt> Stuns
<dd> Threads which are running, but
temporarily stopped because you are debugging them, will often be
found stuck at "locore_exception_return" at the user/kernel boundary
crossing.  In these cases, you'll actually see two adjacent frames at
the crossing. The younger boundary frame will reflect the contents of
the kernel registers at that frame. The older boundary frame will
reflect the contents of the (interrupted) user context

</dl>


<A NAME="dynamicLink"><H2>Debugging Dynamically Linked Code</H2></A>

GDB, together with a bit of careful attention on your part, allows you
to debug dynamically linked code.  The basic model of how to do this is:

<UL>
<LI> Dynamically link your code into the SPIN kernel.
<LI> Ask the kernel where your dynamically linked code has gone.
<LI> Tell gdb where it's gone.
</UL>

Here's an example interaction, starting with the <A HREF="../../user/shell/doc/index.html">SPIN
Shell</a> dialog:
<pre>
Shell Started.
!>load noconf trust tftp /spin/becker/hello.o
DownLoad: tftp: /spin/becker/hello.o  got 1712 bytes
!>Calling domain_entry()
        hello,world
        my return value is 0xc0ffee
domain_entry() returned 0xc0ffee

!>
!>show loadmaps
1. /spin/becker/hello.o 0xfffffc0000e87980 size=96 (untrusted) 
        .text start=0xfffffc0000e87980 size=0x60
        .xdata start=0xfffffc0000e87a00 size=0x10
        .pdata start=0xfffffc0000e87a10 size=0x10
        .data start=0xfffffc0000e87a20 size=0x30
        .lita start=0xfffffc0000e87a50 size=0x10
!>show domains
1. SpinPublic (trusted) 
        . SpinPublicCcode (trusted) 
2. SpinTrusted (trusted) 
        . SpinTrustedCcode (trusted) 
3. Device (trusted) 
4. Console (trusted) 
5. CAM (trusted) 
6. Rofs (trusted) 
7. RofsTftp (trusted) 
8. /spin/becker/hello.o 0xfffffc0000e87980 size=96 (untrusted) 
</pre>

The two important commands here are "show loadmaps" and "show
domains".  The former shows the dynamic linking map information for
only dynamically linked domains. The latter shows information for all
domains. Note that static domains do not include any coff information.

 <P>
The key number is the .text addres, which is the first number shown
after the domain name, and then repeated in the actual loadmap.

Now, you've got to get this information into gdb.  You can do this
automatically with domain sweep or manually with add-symbol-file.

The automatic method creates a new domain in gdb, gets the file names
and addresses from the target, reads the symbol files
and pushes the new domain onto the domain stack:
<pre>
	gdb>domain sweep
</pre>

The manual method does each step by hand:
<pre>
	gdb>add-symbol-file  object-file-name  text_start_address
</pre>

Where text_start_address  is what "show loadmaps" gives you.

 <P>

If you load a .o file that defines symbols already defined, you will
cause gdb to complain about multiply defined symbols.
You need to use the <A NAME="#gdb-domains">domain machinery</A> here as in:
<pre>
		domain create foo
		domain push foo
		add-symbol-file object-file-name text_start_address
</pre>

For example,
<pre>
(gdb) domain create hello
(gdb) domain push hello
 Domain default (current domain not at top of domain stack
objfile-name = /afs/cs.washington.edu/project/spin/bershad/spin/sal/SPIN/spin_k
ernel.sys: 0xffffffffffffffff-0x0)
*Domain hello (EMPTY)
(gdb) add-symbol-file /afs/cs/project/spin/becker/hello.o 0xfffffc0000e87980
add symbol table from file "/afs/cs/project/spin/becker/hello.o" at text_addr = 0xfffffc0000e87980?

(gdb) disassemble domain_entry

(gdb) 
</pre>


<A NAME="disconnect"><h2>Disconnecting from and halting the target</h2></A>

Once you've finished debugging the target, you should be a good citizen and gracefully detach.  Two commands are available to you for this:
<dl>
<dt> detach
<dd> disconnects from current target.

<dt> detach HALT
<dd> disconnects from current target and causes target to
go to PROM. (Useful for when things get really wedged, which is
occasionally).
</dl>

In addition, if you find that you are unable to attach to a running
target, then you can do a hard kill without ever connecting. For example,
<dl>
<dt> target ttd target-host HALT

<dd> will force the target-host to shutdown to the boot prom,
irrespective of the current state of the target.
<dd> If you find that you are having to do a lot of hard kills, then this implies a problem with the TTD implementation.  Please let me know about it.

</dl>

<A NAME="problems"><h2>Problems and hints</h2></A>

Although you should never experience any problems, you might. Here are
some and what you can do about them:

<h3>How do I debug system initialization?</h3>
You need to boot with the t (for ttd) flag, or T if you're into Capitals.
<pre>
>>> boot -fi "spin.boot" -fl t ez0
</pre>


<h3>I can't seem to connect to my target?</h3>

<h4> Who am I? </h4>

TTD relies on bootp so that the target can determine its IP
address. At boot time, the kernel should find a bootp server to tell
it this.  If the bootp server is down, or it doesn't know about the
target machine, then you won't be able to run ttd. Currently, we run a
bootp server on silk.cs.washington.edu.  You'll need to check
/etc/bootptab on spin to make sure that it knows who you are.
Reminder: the target must be on the same
subnet as the bootpserver.

<h4> The target is wedged </h4>

The target keeps track of minimal state about any TTD session, but it
does remember whether or not there is currently a session. The
protocol will let you "break into" a current session (or a session
which terminated uncleanly), but gdb will first ask "target is
currently being debugged; connect anyway?"  Most of the time, the
affirmative will do the right thing here. On occasion, I've seen the
server become completely non-responsive.  Please let me know if you
see this.

<h4> HALT doesn't work </h4>

Try again.  Basically, when sending a HALT request to a wedged
machine, you're throwing packets at it with the hopes that the lance
driver will see the one that says "halt."  A wedged machine is not
particularly good at fielding packets however, so you may need to try
this several times before your packet gets through.

<h4> The target is dead </h4>

TTD unfortunately does not replace rconsole for our machines.  It is
necessary to boot initially from the alpha's PROM prompt in order to
get the kernel loaded and running ttd.  If the kernel is already sitting at the PROM, TTD won't work. I always run a separate rconsole window to the PROM just to make sure I know what's going on.

<h3> GDB won't let me read or write memory.</h3>

TTD is pretty forgiving when asked to read or write memory. Basically,
you can write any piece of the kernel's address space, and any piece
of any user address space provided that the map for that address space
contains the address.  Of course, if you try to access some
non-existent memory, gdb will fail and you'll get a little error
message.  Don't worry about it.  GDB tries to cache memory on the
debugger, so when you ask to read just a single byte, you may still
see an error as GDB may try to read several hundred.

<h3> The target is printing all kinds of little messages to the console.</h3>

Most status messages are silently reflected back to GDB. Sometimes
though, the target will print additional information to the console.
Some messages you may see are "ttd: paged out page," which means that
ttd had to fault a page before you could access it, or "invalid
address" which means that gdb asked ttd to access a bad address.
<p>

There are a set of "debugging" variables that you can set directly
from gdb if you like. These will let you more closly monitor what the
target is doing. Under normal circumstances, you shouldn't need to use
these:

<dl>
<dt> ttd_debug
<dd> general debugging flag. Shows lots of information about requests
as they arrive.  May slow the target down so much so as to make gdb
think it's not responding.

<dt> ttd_thread_debug
<dd> shows control and status messages for ttd operations involving
thread manipulation.

<dt> ttd_machine_debug
<dd> shows debugging information for the machine-dependent layer of the target. This shows, for example, individual register manipulations.

<dt> ttd_access_debug
<dd> shows debugging information for kernel memory acceses.

<dt> ttd_uaccess_debug
<dd> shows debugging information for user memory accesses.

</dl>

In addition, you can set the gdb pseudo-variable $ttd-debug to "on" in
order to get additional debugger-side debugging information.
<pre>
	(gdb) set ttd-debug on
	(gdb) set ttd-debug off
</pre>

<H3>GDB is confused about what language I am using</H3>

Sometimes GDB will think you are debugging C code when you want to look at M3 code, or vice versa.  GDB uses a simple heuristic to figure out what kind of program text and symbols you are looking at. Sometimes, the heuristic is wrong. To force gdb to let you view the world through one language view or another, say:
<pre>
set lang c
</pre>
or
<pre>
set lang m3
</pre>
This will override whatever GDB thinks is the current language.

<h3>GDB won't find my source files.</h3>

Make sure that you have specified the full path name of your object
files, and that those object files were compiled against a full source
tree.

<h3>So much typing to connect and debug server and kernel!</h3>
Yes.  An easy thing to do is to have a startup script for kernel debugging.
Here's the one I use:
<pre>
dir  /afs/cs/project/spin/bershad/sirpa/obj/alpha/mk/kernel/DEFAULT
dir  /afs/cs/project/spin/bershad/work/obj/alpha/osf/server/DEFAULT
file /afs/cs/project/spin/bershad/sirpa/obj/alpha/mk/kernel/DEFAULT/mach_kernel.SK1.DEFAULT
target ttd spincycle
domain create osf
domain push osf
file /afs/cs/project/spin/bershad/work/obj/alpha/osf/server/DEFAULT/vmunix.OSFSRV1.DEFAULT
thread sweep
where
</pre>
You'll need to change yours accordingly.

<h3>How do I use DDB and GDB at the same time?</h3>

You can't. You can use one or the other until DDB is completely
eliminated from the kernel build.  As long as you are not presently
"connected" to the target, it's fine for you to hit ctrl-P at rconsole
and type away.  Once connected, though, the target will get very
confused if you speak at it through both GDB and DDB.  Please don't.
<p>
One (temporary) advantage of keeping the kernel bilingual for now
is that any fatal bugs in ttd cause the kernel to drop into kdb, which
at least makes the debugger debuggable.

I am sure there are plenty.  Please report them to me as you discover
them and I'll try to fix ASAP.
