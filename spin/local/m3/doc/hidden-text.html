<h1>Subclassing Opaque Types</br></h1>

If you create a subclass of a partially revealed superclass, all of
the superclass methods are still in your interface, even if they
were hidden to you.

For example, suppose there another interface to <code>Directory</code>
that reveals some more of <code>Directory.T</code>, as illustrated
below.  Given that interface, a malicious user could do the following:

<pre>
IMPORT Directory, DirectoryFriend, FileSystemDirectory;

NARROW(NEW(FileSystemDirectory.T), Directory.T).oops();
</pre>
