<h1>VIEW description</br></h1>
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

We need a type-safe casting mechanism to avoid copying
when communicating across untyped channels.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<code> 
   VIEW ( expr, type )
</code>
<p>

<code>VIEW</code> can be used to impose a "view" of a region of memory
as a different type.  This view is type-safe -- it will not cause any
unchecked runtime errors.  <code>VIEW</code> only incurs runtime
checks when the <code>VIEW</code> occurs.
<p>

The first argument, <code>expr</code>, must be a designator; that is,
it must describe a region of memory.  The result of the
<code>VIEW</code> is a designator, and is writable if
<code>expr</code> is writable.  Following are the restrictions
on the use of <code>VIEW</code> in more detail.
<p>

We make use the following definitions:

<ul>

<li> A type A is "representation-equivalent" to a type B if every legal
bit pattern in B can be padded to form a legal bit pattern in A, and
every legal bit pattern in A can be truncated to form a legal bit
pattern in B.  Representation-equivalence is not necessarily symmetric.
<p>

<li> A type is "representation-complete" (a term taken from DEC SRC)
if every bit pattern is a legal instance of the type.<p>

In our implementation, the set of non-representation-complete
types consist of the following: REF, object, procedure, opaque REF,
enum, subrange, set, float.
</ul>

A <code>VIEW</code> would be legal whenever the type of
<code>expr</code> --- call it <code>T</code> is
representation-equivalent to <code>type</code>.  Our implementation is
simpler than this, and allows a <code>VIEW</code> under one of the
following conditions:

<ol>

<li>
The type of <code>expr</code> is representation-equivalent to
<code>type</code>.  The following <code>VIEW</code> is legal:

<pre>
	VAR x: RECORD a, b: INTEGER := 3; END;
	BEGIN
	  VIEW (x, RECORD a: INTEGER; END).a := 255;
	END;
</pre>

Our check for representation-equivalence is not much weaker than type
equality.  That is, A is representation-equivalent to B if A is equal
to B, with the following weakening:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Field names and defaults in record types are irrelevant
to the representation.
<li>
If A is a <code>RECORD</code> type, it can have extra fields at the
end that B does not have.
</ul>
<p>
As a result, our implementation does not support the following
<code>VIEW</code>:

<pre>
	VAR x: RECORD a, b: INTEGER; END;
	BEGIN
          (* this is not supported by our implementation *)
	  VIEW (x, RECORD a: INTEGER; b: RECORD a: INTEGER; END; END).a := 255;
	END;
</pre>

<p>

<li>
Representation-equivalence can be determined due to
representation-completeness.

<ul>
<li>

If <code>expr</code> is writable, then <code>expr</code>
must be representation-complete.
<p>

If this condition were not present, then the following would
be legal:
<p>

<pre>
	VAR x: [0..254];
	BEGIN
	  VIEW (x, [0..255]) := 255;  (* this is not legal! *)
	END;

</pre>
<p>

<li>

If expr is an open array, the array elements must not be open arrays.
<p>

This is a restriction made for the sake of simplicity, as we have
not seen any need for <code>VIEW</code>ing multi-dimensional open arrays.

<p>
<li>
<code>type</code> must be representation-complete.
<p>

If this condition were not present, the following would be legal:
<p>

<pre>
	VAR x: [0..255] := 254;
	BEGIN
	  WITH y = VIEW (x, [0..254]) DO
	   x := 255;
	   (* y is now 255, which is illegal! *)
	  END;
	END;
</pre>

<li>

If <code>type</code> is an open array type, it cannot contain any
open arrays.
<p>

Without this restriction, there would be no means of determining
the size of the resulting array.
<p>

<li>
Finally, we impose two restrictions regarding the relationship of
<code>expr</code> and <code>type</code>.  First, the size of
<code>type</code>
must be less than or equal to
that of <code>expr</code>.  Second, the alignment of the
<code>expr</code> must satisfy the alignment of <code>type</code>.
If the sizes and alignments are known at compile-time,
the check is performed there; otherwise, there is a run-time
check.

</ul>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

These examples are not ones from within SPIN, because there are too
many types involved.

<pre>
TYPE T = RECORD
	   a: INTEGER;
	   b: INTEGER;
           c: INTEGER;
         END;


PROCEDURE p(x: ARRAY [0..10] OF INTEGER; y: ARRAY OF INTEGER;
            z: ARRAY [0..100] OF [0..255]) =
  BEGIN
    WITH t = VIEW (x, T) DO
      (* legal, no runtime check because sizes are known statically,
         and alignments match *)
    END
    WITH t = VIEW (y, T) DO
      (* legal, a runtime size check on the open array.  alignments
         match *)
    END
    WITH t = VIEW (z, T) DO
      (* legal, a runtime alignment check, because z is only
         aligned on an 8-bit boundary *)
    END
  END p;
</pre>
