<h2>Motivation</h2>

We need some mechanism for handling checked runtime errors in
Modula-3.  We have added implicit exceptions, which are exceptions
that any procedure can raise.


<h2>Implementation</h2>

The compiler takes a pragma <* IMPLICIT *>, which is used to suppress
warnings about implicit exceptions.
<p>

<code>
<* IMPLICIT *> EXCEPTION Foo;
</code>
<p>

This pragma means that foo can be raised by any procedure.
<ul>
<li> Do not issue a warning if a procedure raises it, and Foo is not
in its RAISES clause.
<li> Do not issue a warning if a TRY EXCEPT block catches Foo, even if
nothing in the block apparently RAISES Foo.
</ul>

The SPIN runtime translates checked runtime errors into implicit
exceptions.
