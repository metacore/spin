<h1>EXTERNAL Declarations are UNSAFE</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

An external declaration in a Modula-3 interface can potentially be
un-typesafe, because Modula-3 cannot determine that the definition
matches the declaration, since the definition is in another language.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

We have prohibited the use of external declarations in safe
interfaces. The recommended way to use external declarations is to
split an interface into safe and unsafe parts and include the word
Extern in the name of the unsafe part.  For example, split Clib.i3
into a safe Clib.i3 and an unsafe ClibExtern.i3.  Then import
ClibExtern into Clib.m3.  Clib will be an unsafe module, but that is
legal because an unsafe module can export a safe interface.
