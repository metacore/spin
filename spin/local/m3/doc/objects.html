<h1>Restrictions on object methods</br></h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

Modula-3 allows a "class method" to be named via the following
syntax:

<code>
TYPE.METHODNAME
</code>

This returns the actual procedure that the method is bound to.  The
problem is that this procedure can be called on any object that is a
subtype of TYPE, even if the subtype has overridden METHODNAME for its
objects.  This is a safety hole, because it allows clients to break
the abstraction that the subtype provides.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

We have added the following restrictions on using the
<code>TYPE.METHODNAME</code> syntax:

<ol>
<li> This syntax can only be used in the scope of the full revelation of
a subtype of TYPE.

<li> When this syntax is used, the resulting procedure it can only be
used in the function position of a call.  It cannot be passed as
argument or stored anywhere.

</ol>
