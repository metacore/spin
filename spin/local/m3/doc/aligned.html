<h1>ALIGNED FOR description</br></h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

We need finer control over data structure alignment when dealing with
C, because C compilers will make arbitrary alignment decisions that we
have to match.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<code> 
   ALIGNED n FOR T
</code>
<p>

<code>ALIGNED FOR</code> can be used to specify a particular alignment
for a type (instead of the default alignment that a particular
compiler may give).  However, no arbitrary alignment can be specified:
in particular, a type's alignment may only be boosted (and only when
the boosting does not introduce padding).  We have also disabled
automatic alignment boosting in our compiler.

<p>

Analogous with <code>BITS FOR</code>, <code>ALIGNED n FOR T</code> is
a subtype of <code>T</code>.

<p>

Let <code>d</code> be the most restrictive alignment of <code>T</code>
(under the typical rules that one might expect).  <code>n</code> must
be a multiple of <code>d</code>.  In addition, <code>n</code> must not
be greater than then size of <code>T</code>; this prevents
<code>ALIGNED FOR</code> from being used to insert padding, which must
be inserted by hand.

<p>

Note: <code>ALIGNED FOR</code> works on <code>RECORD</code> and
<code>ARRAY</code> types.  Given the above restrictions on the use of
<code>ALIGNED FOR</code>, I don't think it can be usefully used with
other types.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<pre>

(* In the SRC M3 implementation, this record would be 32-bit aligned.
   Our compiler aligns it to 8 bits, and type T1 would be used if a
   32-bit aligned record were desired.
 *)
TYPE T = RECORD
	   a: BITS 8 FOR [0..255];
	   b: BITS 8 FOR [0..255];
	   c: BITS 8 FOR [0..255];
	   d: BITS 8 FOR [0..255];
	 END;

TYPE T1 = ALIGNED 32 FOR RECORD
	   a: BITS 8 FOR [0..255];
	   b: BITS 8 FOR [0..255];
	   c: BITS 8 FOR [0..255];
	   d: BITS 8 FOR [0..255];
	 END;
