<h1>Using RTCode to access module descriptors</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

We need to allow modules to talk about themselves and the interfaces
they import. We have two examples where this is necessary. First, we
want to make the module which exports a procedure responsible for
approving other handlers installed on that procedure.  This requires
that the module can provide some unforgeable proof of its identity
when it installs its default handler.  Second, a module which wants to
create a Domain containing code exported by an interface
<code>X</code> will be required to have imported <code>X</code>.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

The SRC Modula-3 system already defines symbols called
<code>MI_*</code> for interfaces and MM_* for modules which have the
type <code>UNTRACED REF RT0.ModuleInfo</code>, but these symbols are
not accessible from Modula-3 code. Our solution is to create two new
builtin functions called <code>THIS_MODULE()</code>, which returns the
<code>MM_</code> symbol for the module in which the function appears,
and <code>INTERFACE_UNIT(X)</code> which returns <code>MI_X</code> for
the named interface. Since <code>THIS_MODULE()</code> takes no
argument, it is impossible for one module to get the descriptor for a
second unless the second one explicitly provides it.  Also the only
names which may be passed to <code>INTERFACE_UNIT()</code> are those
which are explicitly imported in the calling module.

Additionally, we want to ensure that arbitrary safe programs cannot
alter the contents of the interface or module descriptors, nor can
they forge descriptors. So we define two opaque types which are the
return types of <code>THIS_MODULE()</code> and
<code>INTERFACE_UNIT(X)</code>.

<pre>
INTERFACE RTCodeBuiltin;
TYPE
    Module <: ADDRESS;      (* return type of THIS_MODULE()    *)
    Interface <: ADDRESS;   (* return type of INTERFACE_UNIT() *)
END RTCodeBuiltin.
</pre>

The revelations of these types occur in RTCode.m3.
<pre>
REVEAL RTCodeBuiltin.Module = UNTRACED BRANDED REF RT0.ModuleInfo;
REVEAL RTCodeBuiltin.Interface = UNTRACED BRANDED REF RT0.ModuleInfo;
</pre>

We provide a second interface, called <code>RTCode</code>, that is
imported by callers of <code>THIS_MODULE()</code> and
<code>INTERFACE_UNIT()</code>.  This interface declares two procedures
that answer questions about modules.
<code>ModuleExportsInterface</code> determines if the module
<code>m</code> exports any of the procedures declared in the interface
<code>i</code>. <code>ModuleImplementsProcedure</code> determines if
the procedure referred to by <code>p_ref</code> is defined in the
module <code>m</code>.

<pre>
INTERFACE RTCode;
IMPORT RTCodeBuiltin;

TYPE
    Module = RTCodeBuiltin.Module;
    Interface = RTCodeBuiltin.Interface;

(* returns true iff m exports a function declared in i *)
PROCEDURE ModuleExportsInterface(m: Module; i: Interface): BOOLEAN;

(* return true iff m defines procedure p *)
PROCEDURE ModuleImplementsProcedure(m: Module; p_ref: PROCANY): BOOLEAN; 
</pre>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

Our implementation has some quirks of which users should be aware.
First, you must explicitly import an interface before you can call
<code>INTERFACE_UNIT()</code> with that interface name.  Just
exporting an interface from a module is not enough to bring that
interface's name into the top level scope of a module.  A second
related problem is that it is impossible to refer to the interface
exported by a generic module, because you cannot name that interface
at all. But you may use <code>INTERFACE_UNIT()</code> for other
interfaces inside a generic module.

The third problem is that the
<code>RTCode.ModuleExportsInterface</code> function deduces the export
relationship by looking for exported procedures.  It is possible for a
module to contain an <code>EXPORTS</code> declaration but not export
any procedures, in which case this function will return
<code>FALSE</code>.

<h2>Examples</h2>

These examples show how we expect to use the runtime descriptors
in the <code>Domain</code> and <code>Dispatcher</code> interfaces.

<pre>
	Domain.CreateFromInterface(i: RTCode.Interface): T
	(* safely create a domain *)

	Dispatcher.InstallAuthHandler(THIS_MODULE(), event, authHandler)
	(* assert authority over event.  Dispatcher checks
		RTCode.ModuleImplementsProcedure(firstArg, secondArg)
	*)
</pre>
