<h1>M3 OO Style For Safety</br></h1>

When writing object-oriented code in Modula-3, there are a set of
rules that should be followed to help ensure type and system safety.
In each of the following examples we compare some bad OO code to some
<a href="good-code.html">good OO code</a>.

The pages in the following section all use frames, so use a frame-enabled
browser.

<p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

Modula-3 does not distinguish between class interfaces and
implementations.  A <strong>class interface</strong>, which declares
the methods that a class exports, should be declared inside a Modula-3
INTERFACE, and should not declare default methods.  A <strong>class
implementation</strong> should override all of the methods to their
values.  <a href="subclass.html">Otherwise, objects can be treated as
their supertypes, and have all sorts of methods called on them</a>.

<p>

<a href="extension.html">Method extension should be avoided.  It is
very dangerous, because the extended method remains part of the
subclass interface.</a>

<p>

<a href="branded.html">Partially revealed types should be BRANDED, so
that the types cannot be spoofed.</a>

<p>

<a href="hidden.html">Check all of the revelations of a
superclass.  If you create a subclass, then any method of the
superclass is in your interface.</a>

<p>

<a href="override.html">Override any superclass method that could do
bad things to your subclass.  A non-overridden method is effectively
in thesubclass interface.</a>
