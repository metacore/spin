<h1>Exploiting Method Extension</br></h1>

The bad code differs from the good code in that it uses method
extension.  The result is that some malicious code could do the
following:

<pre>
(* calling the "hidden" method *)
EVAL NARROW(NEW(FileSystemDirectory.T), Directory.T).init();
</pre>

One way of still reusing the same name is to introduce an intermediate
type that overrides the original name to <code>NIL</code>.
