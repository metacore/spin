<h1>SPIN Modula-3</h1>

We've made a bunch of changes to Modula-3.  We also have a bunch
of recommendations on safe programming in our version of M3.
<p>

<h2>Style guide</h2>

Certain <a href="style.html">guidelines</a> should be followed when
programming using objects.
<p>

<H2>Language changes</H2>

Here are the changes we have made from standard Modula-3, including
motivation for the change, new syntax and some examples.  A 
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu:80/research/projects/spin/www/papers/WCS/language.ps">paper</a>
describes most of these changes in more detail.

<dl>
<dt> <A HREF="view.html">VIEW</a>
<dd> Typesafe casting

<dt> <A HREF="ephemeral.html">EPHEMERAL procedures</a>
<dd> Procedures which guarantee they won't screw up the system
     even if they are terminated at an arbitrary point.

<dt> <A HREF="functional.html">FUNCTIONAL procedures</a>
<dd> Procedures which don't modify any global state.

<dt> <A HREF="procany.html">PROCANY type</a>
<dd> A supertype for all PROCEDURE types.

<dt> <A HREF="rtcode.html">RTCode interface</a>
<dd> An way to talk about Modula-3 modules and interfaces at runtime.

<dt> <A HREF="external.html">EXTERNAL is UNSAFE</a>
<dd> Any interface containing <*EXTERNAL*> declarations must be
     UNSAFE. 

<dt> <a href="implicit.html">IMPLICIT exceptions</a>
<dd> Exceptions that every procedure may raise, and that
do not need to be declared.

<dt> <a href="aligned.html">ALIGNED FOR</a>
<dd> You can boost the alignment of types that need it.

<dt> <a href="objects.html">Object methods</a>
<dd> Calling and naming object methods explicitly is restricted.

<dt> <a href="cvar.html">CVAR</a>
<dd> Calling C functions with call-by-reference.

</dl>

<h2>Compiler options</h2>

We have added the following compiler options:

<dl>

<dt> -NoLoopholeWarnings
<dd> Do not give warnings for <code>LOOPHOLE</code>.  Our compiler issues
a warning for every loophole.

<dt> -SpinRelax
<dd> Turn off SPIN restrictions, so that standard code can be compiled.
For example, turn off the requirement that <code>EXTERNAL</code> be
<code>UNSAFE</code>.

</dl>
