%	m3mkdir is not in LIB_USE, which depends on the BUILD_DIR,
%	but instead just depends on the BASETARGET
%
%

%
% Here are the OS-specific commands
%
% These were for Ultrix but we use them for spin
%

readonly SL = "/"   % the path separator
readonly CR = "\n"  % line break character

readonly proc delete_file(file) is
  local void = unlink_file(file)
end

readonly proc link_file(from, to) is
  delete_file(to)
  exec("-ln", "-s", from, to)
end

readonly proc make_executable(script) is
  exec("@chmod +x", script)
end

readonly proc make_dir(dir) is
  if not defined ("_quiet") write ("m3mkdir ", dir, CR) end

  exec("@" & THISTREE & "/local/" & BASETARGET & "/lib/m3/" & BASETARGET & "/m3mkdir", dir)
end
