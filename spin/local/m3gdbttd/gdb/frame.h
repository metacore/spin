/* A FRAME identifies a specific stack frame.  It is not constant over
   calls to the inferior (frame addresses are, see below).

   This is implemented as a "struct frame_info *".  This file and
   blockframe.c are the only places which are allowed to use the
   equivalence between FRAME and struct frame_info *.  Exception:
   Prototypes in other files use "struct frame_info *" because this
   file might not be included.

   The distinction between a FRAME and a "struct frame_info *" is made
   with the idea of maybe someday changing a FRAME to be something else,
   but seems to me that a "struct frame_info *" is fully general (since
   any necessarily fields can be added; changing the meaning of existing
   fields is not helped by the FRAME distinction), and this distinction
   merely creates unnecessary hair.  -kingdon, 18 May 93.  */

   (PC_IN_CALL_DUMMY) [ON_STACK]; see comments there.  You cannot
   assume that a frame address contains enough information to
   reconstruct the frame; if you want more than just to identify the
   frame (e.g. be able to fetch variables relative to that frame),

   get_prev_frame_info) as needed, and are chained through the next
   and prev fields.  Any time that the frame cache becomes invalid
   (most notably when we execute something, but also if we change how
