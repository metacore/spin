/* Examine an i960 function prologue, recording the addresses at which
   registers are saved explicitly by the prologue code, and returning
   the address of the first instruction after the prologue (but not
   after the instruction at address LIMIT, as explained below).

   LIMIT places an upper bound on addresses of the instructions to be
   examined.  If the prologue code scan reaches LIMIT, the scan is
   aborted and LIMIT is returned.  This is used, when examining the
   prologue for the current frame, to keep examine_prologue () from
   claiming that a given register has been saved when in fact the
   instruction that saves it has not yet been executed.  LIMIT is used
   at other times to stop the scan when we hit code after the true
   function prologue (e.g. for the first source line) which might
   otherwise be mistaken for function prologue.

   The format of the function prologue matched by this routine is
   derived from examination of the source to gcc960 1.21, particularly
   the routine i960_function_prologue ().  A "regular expression" for
   the function prologue is given below:

   (lda LRn, g14
    mov g14, g[0-7]
    (mov 0, g14) | (lda 0, g14))?

   (mov[qtl]? g[0-15], r[4-15])*
   ((addo [1-31], sp, sp) | (lda n(sp), sp))?
   (st[qtl]? g[0-15], n(fp))*

   (cmpobne 0, g14, LFn
    mov sp, g14
    lda 0x30(sp), sp
    LFn: stq g0, (g14)
    stq g4, 0x10(g14)
    stq g8, 0x20(g14))?

   (st g14, n(fp))?
   (mov g13,r[4-15])?
