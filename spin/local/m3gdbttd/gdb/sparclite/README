This directory contains a sample program that runs on a SparcLite eval
board, and demonstrates the use of the remote debugger stub.  This is in
no sense `production' code.  It is simply a working example of how to use
the sparc-stub.c file for interfacing to GDB.

aload.c		Source for a loader utility.  This talks to the Fujitsu boot
		monitor.  Since it uses BFD, it is capable of loading almost
		any executable format.

crt0.s		Startup code to setup the SparcLite hardware, and the C
		environment.  This is where the program actually starts.  It
		calls main().

hello.c		This is a trivial example of a program that you can debug.  It
		demonstrates how to setup the debugger stub, and how to install
		permanent breakpoints in your code.

salib.c		Various utility routines to interface to the peripherals, the
		cache, etc...
