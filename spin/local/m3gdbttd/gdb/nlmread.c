LOCAL FUNCTION

	nlm_symtab_read -- read the symbol table of an NLM file

SYNOPSIS

	void nlm_symtab_read (bfd *abfd, CORE_ADDR addr,

DESCRIPTION

	Given an open bfd, a base address to relocate symbols to, and a
	flag that specifies whether or not this bfd is for an executable
	or not (may be shared library for example), add all the global
	function and data symbols to the minimal symbol table.

/* Scan and build partial symbols for a symbol file.
   We have been initialized by a call to nlm_symfile_init, which 
   currently does nothing.

   SECTION_OFFSETS is a set of offsets to apply to relocate the symbols
   in each section.  We simplify it down to a single offset for all
   symbols.  FIXME.

   MAINLINE is true if we are reading the main symbol
   table (as opposed to a shared lib or dynamically loaded file).

   This function only does the minimum work necessary for letting the
   user "name" things symbolically; it does not read the entire symtab.
   Instead, it reads the external and static symbols and puts them in partial
   symbol tables.  When more extensive information is requested of a
   file, the corresponding partial symbol table is mutated into a full
   fledged symbol table by going back and reading the symbols
   for real.

   Note that NLM files have two sets of information that is potentially
   useful for building gdb's minimal symbol table.  The first is a list
   of the publically exported symbols, and is currently used to build
   bfd's canonical symbol table.  The second is an optional native debugging
   format which contains additional symbols (and possibly duplicates of
   the publically exported symbols).  The optional native debugging format
   is not currently used. */
