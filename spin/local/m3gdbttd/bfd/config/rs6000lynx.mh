# Host:  IBM RS/6000 running LynxOS
# This file is derived from rs6000.mh, but it disables COFF archives.  LynxOS
# uses a.out style archives (even though it uses XCOFF binaries).

# Turn on core file support in coff-rs6000.c.  We cannot do this in
# configure.in, as there is no way to distinguish between aix and lynx at the
# critical part of the post-target routine.
