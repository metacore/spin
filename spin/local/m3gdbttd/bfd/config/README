This directory contains target (.mt) and host (.mh) specific Makefile
fragments.  They get added to the Makefile that configure builds.
They are used by {bfd,opcodes,binutils}/configure.in.

make variables that can be set in *.mt:

configure.in figures out which .o files to compile into libbfd.a, and
sets make variable TDEFAULTS, based on these first three variables:

DEFAULT_VECTOR=icoff_little_vec
	The default target; if not specified, there is no default.
	Used in targets.c.
	Not used if the target is an argument to --enable-targets.
SELECT_VECS=icoff_big_vec b_out_vec_little_host b_out_vec_big_host
	Any additional targets to support when this target is
	configured in.  Used in targets.c.
	Not used if configured with --enable-targets=all.
SELECT_ARCHITECTURES=bfd_h8500_arch
	Architectures to support; used in archures.c.
	Not used if configured with --enable-targets=all.
TDEFINES = target-specific cc flags for BFD

make variables that can be set in *.mh:

AR = ar program
AR_FLAGS = cq if the default rc runs out of memory
CC = cc program
CFLAGS = cc flags that also get passed to mkdep and used to compile
	gen-aout and subdirectories
HDEFINES = host-specific cc flags for BFD
HDEPFILES = .o files to add to libbfd.a (trad-core.o)
INSTALL = install program
LDFLAGS = used to compile chew in doc subdirectory (-lmalloc)
RANLIB = ranlib program or dummy (echo or true, they're equivalent)
