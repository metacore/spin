<h1>  m3rpcgen - an RPC protocol compiler for Modula-3 </h1>

m3rpcgen is based on the stub generator from Xerox Parc by Marvin
Theimer.  It was updated to work with Modula-3 version 3.x and SPIN by
<A HREF=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mef>Marc E. Fiuczynski</A>

<h2> Synopsis </h2>
<pre>
  m3rpcgen [options] infile
  m3rpcgen [options] [ -c|-h|-l|-s ] [ -o outfile ] [ infile ]
</pre>

<h2> Overview </h2>

m3rpcgen is a tool that generates Modula-3 code to implement an RPC
protocol.  The input to m3rpcgen is a language similar to C known as
<A HREF="../../../user/oncrpc/doc/rfc1014.html">eXternal Data
Representation (XDR) language</A>.

m3rpcgen is normally used as in the first synopsis where it takes an
input file and generates up to five output files. If the infile is
named proto.x, then m3rpcgen will generate an interface file in
proto.i3, marshalling routines in proto_x.i3 and proto_x.m3,
server-side stubs in proto_s.m3, and client-side stubs in proto_c.m3.

If proto.x contains no type definitions in it then the files
proto_x.i3 and proto_x.m3 will not be produced since there will be no
marshalling routines.  If proto.x does not contain any program
definitions (i.e. it contains only constant and/or type definitions)
then the files proto_c.m3 and proto_s.m3 will not be produced since
there will be no client or server stubs.

The other synopses shown above are used when one does not want to
generate all the output files, but only a particular one.  Their usage
is described in the USAGE section below.

The C-preprocessor, cpp(1), is run on all input files before they are
actually interpreted by m3rpcgen, so all the cpp directives are
legal within an m3rpcgen input file.  For each type of output file,
m3rpcgen defines a special cpp symbol for use by the m3rpcgen
programmer:

<pre>
  RPC_HDR     defined when compiling into interface files
  RPC_XDR     defined when compiling into marshalling routines
  RPC_SVC     defined when compiling into server-side stubs
  RPC_CLNT    defined when compiling into client-side stubs
</pre>

In addition, m3rpcgen does a little preprocessing of its own.  Any line
beginning with `%' is passed directly into the output file, uninterpreted
by m3rpcgen.

In order to satisfy the type safety requirements of Modula-3, m3rpcgen must
support explicit importation of other .x interface files.  This is achieved
by having m3rpcgen recognize the line

<pre>
       %#include "proto1.h"
</pre>

(yes, proto1.h) as meaning IMPORT the interface file proto1.i3 into
the various files emitted.  Note that most interface files will
actually contain line sequences of the form:

<pre>
       #if RPC_HDR
       %#ifndef proto1_h
       %#define proto1_h
       %#include "proto1_h"
       %#endif proto1_h
       #endif RPC_HDR
</pre>

in order to accomodate the generation of C code for an interface file.

<h2>Options</h2>
<DL>

<DT> -c 

<DD> Emit only the marshalling routine files (e.g. proto_x.i3 and
proto_x.m3).

<DT>  -h
<DD>   Emit only the Modula-3 data-definitions file (e.g. proto.i3).

<DT>  -l
<DD>   Emit only the client-side stubs file (e.g. proto_c.m3).

<DT>  -s   
<DD>   Emit only the server-side stubs file (e.g. proto_s.m3).

<DT>  -o outfile
<DD>   Specify the name of the output file.  If none is specified, standard
       output is used (-h, -l, -s modes only).  NOTE: Only the base name
       should be specified when this option is used in conjunction with -c
       (which generates two files).  For example, -s -o proto_xdr will yield
       the output files proto_xdr.i3 and proto_xdr.m3.

<DT>  -p 
<DD>   Strip module prefix names from all symbol names encountered.  Whereas
       RPC interface symbols exist in a single name space, Modula-3 symbols
       are defined relative to the modules they are defined.  Without this
       option symbols in an interface file proto.x of the form proto_foo will
       turn into Modula-3 names of the form proto.proto_foo.  When this
       option is specified m3rpcgen will strip the proto_ off each symbol
       name encountered.  That is, the symbol proto_foo will be turned into
       the Modula-3 symbol proto.foo.

<DT>  -e
<DD>   Expand input structure parameters.  RPC Language allows only one
       parameter to each routine.  If this flag is specified, and the parame-
       ter to a routine is a structure, then the corresponding client and
       server stub routines produced will expect one parameter for each field
       of the structure.

<DT>  -f
<DD>   Emit all five files, even if they are not needed.  This option is use-
       ful when dependency makefiles are generated automatically using facil-
       ities such as imake.

<DT>  -r
<DD>   Emit code in the client stubs to assist recovery from failed RPC
       calls.  When creating the client object, the application can provide a
       routine to be called when an RPC fails.  This routine can attempt
       application-specific recovery and return a new connection that the
       stub will use for the retry.
