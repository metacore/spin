/* This file is a bit like libgcc1.c/libgcc2.c in that it is compiled
   multiple times and yields multiple .o files.

   This file is useful on target machines where the object file format
   supports multiple "user-defined" sections (e.g. COFF, ELF, ROSE).  On
   such systems, this file allows us to avoid running collect (or any
   other such slow and painful kludge).  Additionally, if the target
   system supports a .init section, this file allows us to support the
   linking of C++ code with a non-C++ main program.

   Note that if INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP is defined in the tm.h file, then
   this file *will* make use of the .init section.  If that symbol is
   not defined however, then the .init section will not be used.

   Currently, only ELF and COFF are supported.  It is likely however that
   ROSE could also be supported, if someone was willing to do the work to
   make whatever (small?) adaptations are needed.  (Some work may be
   needed on the ROSE assembler and linker also.)

   This file must be compiled with gcc.  */
