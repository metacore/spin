# HISTORY
# 28-Dec-97  Przemek Pardyak (pardy) at the University of Washington
#	Centralized handling of target names, it should all happen in
#	this file.  Improved handling of architecture names in preparation
#	for SMURT.

# Boottime Configuration
#
# MOUNT_POINT is the directory available for NFS mounting
# MOUNT_PAD is the path from MOUNT_POINT to the directory containing
#  the SPIN distribution.
#  Include the trailing "/".
# FETCH_METHOD is the protocol used to fetch the initial extensions.
#  Values can be: tftp, http, or, nfs.
# HTTP_ADDR is the address of the http server for SPIN extensions
# HTTP_PORT is the tcp port of the http server for SPIN extensions

# Build Configuration
#

# INSTALL_DIR is the dir where the BSD tools are installed and
#		where the original M3 distribution from DEC is installed
# ORIGINAL_M3 is the top dir of the DEC SRC m3 installation (INSTALL_ROOT)
# ORIGINAL_M3BUILD is the path to m3build in the DEC SRC m3 distribution
# ORIGINAL_QUAKE is the path to quake in the DEC SRC m3 distribution
# PERL is the perl executable (v4 or v5)
# BISON is the path to the GNU clone of yacc

# M3ARCH is the target type.
#	Use IX86_SPIN, or ALPHA_SPIN for DEC alphas.
# LOCALTARGET is the build host type.
#	Use LINUXELF for PCs, or ALPHA_OSF on DEC alphas.

LOCALTARGET=LINUXELF


#
# FULLTREE is the path to a fully built spin tree.
#	The Makefiles and m3makefiles are designed to look in FULLTREE
#	for directories/files not in THISTREE.
# If your source tree is fully populated, set FULLTREE to THISTREE.
# Note: the following line in the cvs should contain "spin-version"
FULLTREE=$(THISTREE)

#
# THISTREE is the dir prefix of the local source tree.  Our convention
#	is to set THISTREE in each Makefile.  We could try to guess here
#	what the prefix is from pwd, but it was simpler to set it exactly in
#	every makefile 
#	
ifndef THISTREE
You must define THISTREE before including make.conf
endif


#
# TREEFLAGS is an argumnet for m3build to pass it FULLTREE and THISTREE
#	for use in the m3makefiles and quake templates 
#	Tack on -DCAPTURE_M3 to create .M3ARGS file with full m3 command line.
