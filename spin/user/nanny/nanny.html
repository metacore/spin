<H2>Motivation</H2>

Nanny provides a way to use system services without having to worry
about manually loading them or without having to load everything from
boot.


<H2>Overview</H2>

<IMG align=left src=http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/pics/nancartn.gif>

The nanny provides a demand-loading service for objects, such as
domains and devices, which have a nameserver representation.  For each
named entity implemented by a dynamically linked server, nanny watches
for references to the entity and executes a script associated with the
name before the lookup is allowed to complete.

<P>
Nanny is an extension that is generally loaded at system boot time.

<H2>Using Nanny</H2>

Nanny can be used from the shell and directly from programs.  Both interfaces
are described in the <A HREF="src/Nanny.i3">interface file.</A>

We'll only describe the shell interface here.


<DL>
<DT> nanny install name script
<DD> will execute "script" whenever anyone goes to lookup "name" in the name service.


<DT> nanny stat
<DD> shows all services currently being watched by nanny.


<DT> nanny delete name
<DD> removes name from nanny's purview.

<DT> nanny touch service_name
<DD> forces nanny to query service_name, executing any scripts that might be
required.  (This is equivalent to "<A HREF="../ns/ns.html">ns</A> query name")


<DT> nanny zap
<DD> deinstall the current incarnation of nanny. (hackville USA)
</DL>

<H3>An example</H3>

Here's an example that shows how to demand-load CAM whenever anyone
tries to mount a disk.

<PRE>

echo Enabling fs:ufs
nanny install fs:ufs  ~/spin/user/fs/ufs/ALPHA_SPIN/ufs.rc

echo Enabling cam...
nanny install cam ~/spin/user/scripts/caminit.rc

ns install device:rz3a @cam
ns install device:rz3b @cam
ns install device:rz3c @cam
ns install device:rz3d @cam
ns install device:rz3h @cam

</PRE>
This says:
<UL>
<LI> 	if the device subsystem goes to look up rz3[a-h], then return
	to it whatever happens when I follow @cam.

<LI> 	Since cam is nanny'd to caminit.rc, all you have to do is
	"mention" rz3a and you load cam.


<LI> 	Cam will then install it's own device handles into the
	nameserver forcing the ns install to be deleted.




</UL>

Typically, when nanny loads a script for you, that script will
cause the name that nanny loaded to be changed in the
nameserver.  This behavior will change.
