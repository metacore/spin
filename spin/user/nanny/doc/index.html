<H2>Motivation</H2>

Nanny provides a way to use system services without having to worry
about manually loading them or without having to load everything from
boot.


<H2>Overview</H2>

<IMG align=left src="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/pics/nancartn.gif">

The nanny provides a demand-loading service for objects, such as
domains and devices. For each named entity implemented by a
dynamically linked server, nanny watches for references to the entity
and executes a script associated with the name before the lookup is
allowed to complete.

<P>
Nanny is an extension that is generally loaded at system boot time.

<H2>Using Nanny</H2>

Nanny can be used from the shell and directly from programs.  Both interfaces
are described in the <A HREF="../src/Nanny.i3">interface file.</A>

We'll only describe the shell interface here.

<DL>
<DT> <b>nanny install [-f] [-n <var>alias</var>] [<var>name</var>]
     <var>script</var></b>
<DD> will execute "script" whenever anyone goes to lookup "name" in the name service.

     <p>If the "name" is already present in the name space, nanny does nothing,
     unless the <code>-f</code> option is given.
     With <code>-f</code>, nanny reinstalls the name.

     <p><code>-n</code> option is used to set the alias used in
     <code>nanny touch</code>. Without this option, the alias defaults to
     the last component of <code>name</code>. For example,

     <pre>
nanny install /../svc/domains/Sphinx $USER/sphinx/$target/sphinx.rc
     </pre>

     is same as the below.
     
     <pre>
nanny install -n Sphinx /../svc/domains/Sphinx $USER/sphinx/$target/sphinx.rc
     </pre>
     
<DT> <b>nanny delete <var>name</var></b>
<DD> removes name from nanny's purview.

<DT> <b>nanny touch <var>alias</var></b>
<DD> forces nanny to query the alias (registered by <code>install</code>).

<DT> <b>nanny zap</b>
<DD> deinstall the current incarnation of nanny. (hackville USA)
</DL>

<H3>An example</H3>

Here's an example that shows how to demand-load CAM whenever anyone
tries to mount a disk.

<PRE>
nanny install /../svc/fs/ufs $USER/fs/ufs/$target/ufs.rc
nanny install /../svc/domains/Sieg $USER/sieg/$target/sieg.rc
</PRE>

This says:
<UL>
<LI> 	if the file system <code>ufs</code> is referred to in
     "mount" or some other file system related commands the first time,
     nanny executes 
     <code>script $USER/fs/ufs/$target/ufs.rc</code>.
<li> If the domain "Sieg" is referred to during dynamic linking
     (or other occasions where domain is used), 
     <code>script $USER/sieg/$target/sieg.rc</code> is executed.

</UL>

<H3>Nanny Internals</H3>

Nanny creates the directory <code>/../svc/nanny</code> to store
aliases.
