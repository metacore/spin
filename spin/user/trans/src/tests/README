This directory contains various test scripts for the transaction manager.
You need to compile the transaction manager for ALPHA_OSF beforehand.

Each test is self contained. You just have to execute each.

The communication between test script and the transaction manager is
recorded in the file LOG. By executing

db <LOG

you can replay the test. This is useful when debugging.
