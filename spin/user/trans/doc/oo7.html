<h2>OO7 benchmark</h2>

<h3>What's this?</h3>

OO7 is the standard OODB benchmark program developed at U Wisc at
Madison.  It simulates a CAD kind of database in which there are
atomic parts, composite parts, connections among parts, and an index
that addresses the parts.

<p> The number of parts and size of the index structure is
configurable, but there are three stardard configurations, small,
medium, and large.  Small takes about 15MB of disk space, medium takes
about 150MB of disk space and large takes a large amount of disk
space.  In addition to these three standard configurations, I created
the tiny configuration that only takes about 2MB of disk space.


<p>
You can run about 17 types of transactions on the oo7 database.
See <a href="../oo7/OO7.cc">OO7.cc</a> for the full listing, but
below are the ones I often use.

<ul>
  <li> t1 : traverses all the parts read only
  <li> t2a : traverses parts and updates portion of them.
  <li> t2b : traverses parts and updates all of them.
  <li> t2c : traverses parts and updates all of them four times.       
</ul>
