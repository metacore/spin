<h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>

This transaction manager provides 
a file I/O with transaction properties.
It's function is very simliar to Camelot.

<p>Distributed transaction support is still rudimentary.


<h2> Overall structure.</h2>

<ul>
  <li> There are four big modules in the system,
       Transaction, WAL(log), LockMan, and Storage.
       Transaction controls the distributed transaction, wal controls
       logging, lock manages locking,
       and storage actually provides transactional file I/O.
       <dl>
	 <dt> Transaction Manager
	 <dd> The transaction manager controls begin/commit/abort
	      of transactions. It is also responsible for coordinating
	      two phase commit.
	 <dt> WAL
	 <dd> WAL(write ahead log) manager manages a sequential log
	      records. It's interface is reatively low level; it understands
	      the type of each log record(redo, undo, commit, checkpoint, etc),
	      but it doesn't understand the contents any further.
	      WAL also coordinates the recovery on system startup.
	 <dt> Lock Manager
	 <dd> The lock manager is responsible for managing locks on
	      linear regions. It now only supports flat read/write
	      locks.
	 <dt> Storage Manager
	 <dd> Storage manager is an implementation of the transactional
	      service manager.
       </dl>

       <p>
       The service can be used both by user process and the extension.
       From the user process, the interface really looks like Camelot.
       From the extension, the interface is a little unnatural because
       all data transfer has to be done using collection of
       page sized buffers.

  <li> Automatic read/write detection using MMU.

  <li> Integrated memory object manager.

       <p> It has its own cache manager and memory object pager.
       No VM overhead when it's used from the user space!       

  <li> Integrated with Sphinx process manager.

       <p>
       When the process crashes, all the outstanding transactions are
       safely aborted.
       
  <li> Per-node generic logging service.
       
       <p>
       Log manager is separate from either storage manager or transaction
       manager. It's interface is similar to Quicksilver, i.e., its low level.

  <li> Per-node (somehow) generic lock manager.
       <p>
       
       Lock manager is separate from storage manager. This makes easy to
       use the lock manager in other data services.

  <li> Generic transaction manager.

       <p>
       Although there is only one data server in the system(storage manager)
       the transaction manager is designed in such a way that it can
       control any kind of services.

       <p>
       It is strictly two phase; and no shortcircuiting like in Quicksilver
       is allowed.

  <li> Flaky distributed transaction service.

       2PC recovery is still isn't complete.
       
</ul>

<h2>2. Roadmap</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="../src"><strong>src</strong></a>
  <dd> Extension source.
  <dt> <a href="../lib"><strong>lib</strong></a>
  <dd> This directory contains the system call interface library
       <code>libtrans.a</code> and its source codes.
       This is used by user space apps that use
       the service. Also contains RVM emulator. 
  <dt> <a href="../malloc"><strong>malloc</strong></a>
  <dd> Includes persistent <code>trans_malloc</code> and
       <code>trans_free</code>, a persistent heap management
       routines.
  <dt> <a href="rvmbench.html"><strong>rvmbench</strong></a>
  <dd> RVM SOSP benchmark. This is a very simple debit/credit benchmark
       used in the RVM SOSP paper.
  <dt> <a href="oo7.html"><strong>oo7</strong></a>
  <dd> The OO7 benchmark.
</dl>

<h2>OSF/1 version</h2>

The transaction service is designed to run on both SPIN and OSF(UNIX).
On OSF, the extension and the user app are linked together to become
single binary file. The OSF version is only for debugging.

To create the OSF version, edit the toplevel <code>Makefile</code>
and uncomment

<pre>
#export TRANSTARGET=osf
</pre>

and comment out

<pre>
export TRANSTARGET=spin
</pre>

<h2>Testing the Transaction System</h2>

<ul>
  <li> To run rvmbench, first compile everything, and then boot SPIN.
       Then, do the following.
       <pre>
!>script -b
!>script trans.rc
!>sphinx exec ~/spin/user/trans/rvmbench/spin/rvmbench
       </pre>

       See also <a href="rvmbench.html">rvmbench documentation</a>.
       
  <li> To run oo7, do the following.

       <pre>
!>script -b
!>script trans.rc
!>sphinx exec ~/spin/user/trans/oo7/spin/OO7 -g -r /efs/rds_data ~/spin/user/trans/oo7/Config.tiny
!>sphinx exec ~/spin/user/trans/oo7/spin/OO7 -b -r /efs/rds_data ~/spin/user/trans/oo7/Config.tiny 1 t1 t2a t2b
       </pre>
       
       See also <a href="oo7.html">oo7 documentation</a>.
</ul>

<h2>3. Using the Transaction System</h2>

There are sets of two interfaces, one for in-kernel extension and
the other for user space applications.

<h3>3.1 Extension Interface</h3>

There are two interfaces that are visible to clients.

<dl>
  <dt><a href="../src/Transaction.i3">Transaction.i3</a></dt>
  <dd>
       Transaction management is separated from the actual file management.
       This makes it easy to add a new kind of transactional I/O services
       without changing Transaction.[im]3.
       <a href="#log">
       (but the log manager doesn't understand new kind of storage manager
       easily)</a>
       <br>
       
  <dt> <a href="../src/Storage.i3">Storage.i3</a></dt>
  <dd> Storage actually provides the file I/O facility.
</dl>

<h3>3.2 User space application interface</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="../src/TransSyscall.i3">TransSyscall</a></dt>
</dl>

There is also an RVM compatible layer.

<h2>2. Design </h2>

<h3>2.1 Logging </h3>

<p>The transaction property is guaranteed using the write ahead log(WAL).
Both the storage manager and the transaction manager uses
the log. Storage uses it to make things consistent, and trans manager
uses it to support 2PL.  Modifications to storage managers are kept
either using undo-redo protocol or redo procotol. Which protocol to use
is determined by the flag given to <code>Transaction.Begin</code>.

<h3>2.2 Distributed Transactions</h3>

<p>The API when the client is on a remote site is same as local case.

First, client has to call <code>Storage.pin</code>.
This call always makes RPC to the server.
<p><code>Storage.pin</code> will map the server storage contents on the
client memory. There is an internal optimization to check the version
of pages in the region, and if those on the client are up to date,
they are not transferred.

<p>On transaction commit, all the undo-redo logs are transmitted to the
server. Server modifies it's own storage contents using that
log. Thus, after commit, the server and the client have same contents.

<p>Currently, TCP is used for the communication protocol.

<a name="#log">
<h3>2.3 Recovery</h3>

<p>Log recovery is a kind of weird. The log manager first opens a log
file, and immediately starts the recovery.  It looks at each log
record, and upcalls the local storage manager or the transaction
manager to do undo or redo. When it detects unterminated transactions
(ex, prepare, but not committed), it forks off a thread to poll the
storage manager or transaction manager to resolve it.

<p>There are both advantages and disadvantages in this approach.

<p>The advantage is that the recovery gets quicker, because we need only
one scan through the log file. Also, we can truncate the log file
automatically, because once recovery is complete, we are sure that
the log used in the recovery is not used.<br>

<p>The downside is that the log manager has to know who are in the world.
This means that you can't add a new type of the storage manager without
changing the log manager recovery code.<br>

<p>The primary motivation for this design is the log truncation.

<h2>3. Modules</h2>

The transaction manager contains many modules. Here is the
big picture.

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="../src/Transaction.m3">Transaction</a>
  <dd> Transaction manages all the transactions initiated
       on the local host. "Initiated" means you called
       Transaction.Begin on the local host and started the
       transaction.

  <dt> <a href="../src/TransLocal.m3">TransLocal</a>
  <dd> This is a synonym of Transaction.T, and this represents a
       transaction initiated on the local host.

<!-- SPIN DOC EXPORT SECTION IGNORE START -->
  <dt> <a href="../src/TransRemote.m3">TransRemote</a>
  <dd> Transaction module also acts as a manager for remote connections.
       TransRemote is an internal transaction that represents a 
<!-- SPIN DOC EXPORT SECTION IGNORE END -->

  <dt> <a href="../src/Storage.m3">Storage</a>
  <dd> Storage is an abstract object representing storage devices
       participating in local transactions. It can be local or proxy.

  <dt> <a href="../src/StorageLocal.m3">StorageLocal</a>
  <dd> Local storages are the real storages. They maintain a disk on the
       local host. It also exports the methods for local clients.

  <dt> <a href="../src/StorageProxy.m3">StorageProxy</a>
  <dd> Proxy storage is a channel of communication to a storage on
       remote host.

  <dt> <a href="../src/StorageRemote.m3">StorageRemote</a>
  <dd> Sounds confusing, but there is a module called StorageRemote.
       This acts as a RPC server side stub. This module accepts a call from
       StorageProxy of a remote host, and forwards it to the local storage.

  <dt> <a href="../src/WAL.m3">WAL</a>
  <dd> WAL stands for <dfn>Write Ahead Log</dfn>. This module provides
       generic logging service.
       
  <dt> <a href="../src/LockMan.m3">LockMan</a>, the lock manager.
