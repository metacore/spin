<h2>RVM TPC/A benchmark</h2>

<h3>What's this?</h3>

RVM TPC/A benchmark was originally developed by the RVM project team
for use in its SOSP paper. It mimics the TPC/A benchmark in a very
crappy way. The "database" file is a single big C struct described below.

<pre>
struct {
    branch branch;
    teller tellers[10];
    account accounts[NACCOUNTS]
    history history[NACCOUNTS*2];
} root_struct;
</pre>

<code>branch</code>, <code>teller</code>, <code>account</code> are
128 bytes each, and <code>history</code> is 64 bytes each.
<code>NACCOUNTS</code> is a runtime constant that defaults to 32768.

<p>
Each transaction picks one account, and reads the branch, a teller,
the account, and also writes onto the branch, the teller, and the account.
Finally, it appends an entry to history. Thus, one transaction
reads 3 * 128 bytes, and writes 3 * 128 + 64 bytes.

<p>
There are two ways the accounts are picked. <em>Random</em> version
picks an account completely randomly. <em>Localized</em> picks an account
randomly but with certain preference. Default is the localized, but
<code>-r</code> command line option switches the distribution to random.

<h3>Invoking RVM benchmark</h3>

<pre>
rvmbench [-rp] [-n NTRANS] [-d DEV] [-a NACCOUNTS]
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt> -r
  <dd> Random account distribution. Default is localized distribution.
  <dt> -p
  <dd> Run the kernel profiler.
  <dt> -n 
  <dd> Set the number of transactions executed. Default is 4000.
  <dt> -d
  <dd> Set the database name. Default is <code>rds_data</code> on the
       current directory.
  <dt> -a
  <dd> Set the number of accounts. Default is 32768.
</dl>
