<h1>User Threads</h1>

This directory contains different implementations of user threads. The
strands page describes in more detail the thread architecture of
SPIN. This directory contains sample clients of the strand interface
that we use daily. Three different services are provided by the strand
clients: (1) Generic user-level threads (2) CThreads and (3) an Exec
service to populate an address space and start up a thread within it.

<h2>Generic User-Space Threads</h2>

<p>
The generic user-level thread support is provided by the
UserSpaceThread package. These threads resemble provide basic thread
functionality, and export an interface that resembles that of Mach.
UserSpace threads support clients that perform floating point
operations. The interface is given below:

<dl>
<dt><b>Create(space: Space.T) : T</b>
<dd>
Create a new UserSpacethread, with space as its address map
The newly created thread needs to be explicitly activated via the
Resume call in order to execute.

<dt><b> Destroy(Uthread: T)</b>
<dd>Release the resources held by a dead thread.


<dt><b> Suspend(Uthread: T)</b>
<dd>Stop the execution of the named thread. A Suspend operation is
necessary before any Get or SetState calls. 
Suspend and Resume keep a suspend count and the thread is suspended
on the 0->1 transition and resumed on the 1->0 transition. That is, 
nested suspends and resumes work intuitively.

<dt><b> Resume(Uthread: T)</b>
<dd>Resume the execution of the named thread.

<dt><b> Externalize(Uthread: T; intptr: REFANY;
        desiredSlot : Word.T := ExternalRef.DontCare) : Word.T</b> 
<dd>Externalize an in-kernel pointer to pass to user side. The user space
thread can hold and name in-kernel capabilities by externalizing them.


<dt><b> Internalize(Uthread: T; extptr: Word.T) : REFANY</b>
<dd>Internalize a previously externalized user-side reference to an
in-kernel reference.

<dt><b> GetState(Uthread: T; VAR state: State)</b>
<dd>Get the CPU and FPU register state of the thread in question. State is
an OUT variable.

<dt><b> SetState(Uthread: T; state: State)</b>
<dd>Set the CPU and FPU register state of the thread in question.

<dt><b> GetSpace(Uthread: T) : Space.T</b>
<dd>Get the address space that a given thread is running in.

<dt><b>Self(): T</b>
<dd>Return the user space space thread on whose behalf this kernel thread 
is running.
</dl>

<h2>CThreads</h2>

There are two different implementations of cthreads, the threads
interface originally developed by Cooper and Draves for Mach. One
implementation is based directly on strand events, using low-level
strand machinery to implement CThread semantics. The other is a
layered implementation that uses UserSpaceThreads to implement
CThreads in the kernel. The latter implementation was made in order to
compare and quantify the effects of moving code across the user-kernel
boundary. 

The interface exported by the Cthread packages kernel component is
given below. The rest of the functionality of CThreads is implemented
in user space.

<dl>

<dt><b>Fork(th: UserSpaceThread.T; startpc,arg,gp,ra,startsp: Word.T) : T</b>
<dd> Create a new thread of execution. The newly created thread may begin
its execution at some point during the course of this call. Hence it
would be unwise to make any assumptions about the state of the client
thread without explicitly synchronizing with it. The thread starts at
address startpc, with argument arg in a0, ra, gp and sp set to the
values passed in to Fork.

<dt><b>Exit(cthread: T; exitcode: Word.T)</b>
<dd>Terminate the execution of a CThread. The exitcode is made
available to clients who can Join with the thread.

<dt><b>Join(cthread: T) : Word.T</b>
<dd>Wait for a CThread to complete its execution and capture the
result it returns. More than one client can perform a Join operation.

<dt><b>RegisterRas(cthread: T; beginpc, len: Word.T)</b>
<dd>Registers a restartable atomic sequence. If the CThread is interrupted
within this sequence, its pc will be rolled back to the beginning of
the region. The thread will then resume from the beginning of the
region when it is next scheduled.
