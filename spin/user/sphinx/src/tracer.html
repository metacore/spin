<H2>Overview</H2>

Dlib tracer is an add-on extension to the <!href="dlib"><a href="../../../user/dlib/doc/index.html">Dlib</a> service.
It peeks at all the system call events destined to the dlib, and
it logs the arguments passed to each of them. Then, it sends out
the log to a specified machine using the UDP protocol.<p>

This extension is created primarily to demonstrate the flexible 
systemcall emulation service structure, so
it won't serve any practical purpose now.<p>

It's interesting to compare this service with
<code>trace</code> command supported in some UNIXes(e.g., Sun OS).

<H2>Design and Implementation</H2> 

The tracer is an extension, and it is invoked in reponse to
the <code>MachineTrap.Syscall</code> event. Dlib extension itself and
the tracer are both dispatched for a single system call event. The tracer is
invoked first(by specifying
Dispatcher.Opt.First to <!href="dispatcher"><a href="../../../kernel/spincore/src/dispatch/doc/index.html">Dispatcher.Install</a>).
It records the register packet, and passes the control to the
next event handler, which is usually the Dlib extension.<p>


When the log becomes full, it is output to a remote host using the UDP
protocol. The name of the remote host is specified by the 
<code>tracer</code> shell command described later.<p>


<block> Actually, the log is managed in circular bounded-buffer style
you may see in any textbook. There are fixed number(5) of logs, and
the tracer and UDP sender act as the producer and the consumer,
respectively.

<H2>Using the service</H2>

First you have to load the extension. Assuming you've 
done <code>script -b</code>, all you have to do is

<pre>
!>nanny touch tracer
</pre>

The tracer installs a shell command <code>tracer</code> when it's
loaded. All the functions of the tracer can be controlled via this
command.

<dl>
  <dt> <b><code>tracer on </code><var>host</var></b>
  <dd> This command installs the tracer, and sets the remote host
       to be <var>host</var>. 
       
  <dt> <b><code>tracer fancy </code><var>host</var></b>
  <dd> This is same as <code>tracer on</code>, except that the tracer
       uses fancy logging format. Fancy logging format records each
       system call name(instead of system call number), and
       for arguments that are supposed to be a text type, it
       records the text pointed to by the register
       instead of register value itself.

       Of course, all these fanciness makes logging very slow.
       
  <dt> <b><code>tracer fake </code><var>host</var></b>
  <dd> This is same as <code>tracer on</code>, except that the tracer
       doesn't output any packets to the network. This sounds meaningless,
       but it serves as a basepoint for performance comparison.
       
  <dt> <b><code>tracer off </b></code>
  <dd> Uninstalls the tracer handler from the systemcall event.
