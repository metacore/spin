<h2>Overview</h2>

<strong>Sphinx</strong> is an extension that implements the UNIX
system calls.  It can run programs compiled for DEC UNIX or
FreeBSD.

<p>
Dynamic linking is supported on OSF/1, however with some warnings.

<ul>
  <li> The default loader is at <code>/spin/bin/loader</code>.
       You can change the loader path by setting the SPIN shell variable
       <code>LOADER_PATH</code>.
  <li> You need NFS to execute any dynlinked app
       (do <code>script ~/spin/user/scripts/mount.rc</code>)
</ul>

<p>
The PC version does not support dynlinking.

<p>
Lots of system calls are missing. You won't be able to
run some applications. If you are in doubt, use the
system call tracer(<code>syscall trace</code>)
to find out what system calls your app is using.

<h2>Compilation, and Link</h2>

<h3>DEC UNIX</h3>

No special flags are needed any more.

<h3>PC Compatibles</h3>

<p>
You have to use FreeBSD statically linked binaries.
At UW, <code>/spin/bin/bsd-newcc</code> on Linux box(es) is the
cross compiler that produces FreeBSD binary. It is actually gcc, so
you have to pass

<pre>
-static
</pre>

option when linking.

<p>
When installing GNU softwares, do
<pre>
<code>
% setenv LDFLAGS -static
</code>
</pre>

before running <code>configure</code>.

<a name="running"></a>
<h2>Running</h2>

The sphinx apps are first started using <code>sphinx</code> shell command.

<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> <code>exec</code> shell command does not work any more.
</blockquote>

<pre>
!>sphinx exec ~/spin/user/sphinx/progs/hello
</pre>

When running a dynamically linked binary, you first have to load NFS.

<pre>
!> nanny touch Sphinx
!> script ~/spin/user/script/mount.rc
!> sphinx exec /usr/local/bin/wish -f <em>your-script</em>
</pre>

You can also pass arguments to the child proc.

<pre>
!>sphinx exec /spin/yasushi/sphinx/progs/hello hi there
</pre>

In the above example, <code>hi</code> and <code>there</code> are passed to
the user program. In the user program, you can access them using
familiar <code>argc</code>, <code>argv</code> protocol.

<p>
Shell variables are passed to the child proc as environment variables.

<p>
The <code>sphinx</code> shell command supports several subcommands.

<dl>
  <dt> <code>sphinx install</code>
       
  <dd> This command installs the sphinx extension on the
       MachineTrap.Syscall event for any threads. This command is valid, but
       is <strong>deprecated</strong>.
       You really don't need to execute this command to run
       UNIX binaries.
       
  <dt> <code>sphinx uninstall</code>
  <dd> Uninstalls the extension installed by "sphinx install".
       This command is deprecated also.

  <dt> <code>sphinx ps</code>
  <dd> Lists the active processes.
       
  <dt> <code>sphinx kill <var>pid</var> <var>signo</var></code>
  <dd> Send the signal <var>signo</var> to the process <var>pid</var>.
       This command often doesn't work especially when the process is hung
       inside the systemcall handler.

  <dt> <code>sphinx trace</code>
  <dd> Installs a system call tracer. For each system call, the tracer
       displays the name of the service and arguments.
  <dt> <code>sphinx untrace</code>
  <dd> Uninstalls the system call tracer.

  <dt> <code>sphinx exec <var>PATH ARGS...</var></code>
  <dd> starts a UNIX program <var>PATH</var>, giving arguments
       <var>ARGS...</var>.
       The difference between <var>exec</var>
       shell command and this command is that
       the "exec" shell command starts the application without setting up any
       system call handlers. "sphinx exec" installs the sphinx syscall handler
       before starting the application.
  <dt> <code>sphinx texec <var>PATH ARGS...</var></code>
  <dd> starts <var>PATH</var> with the tracer installed for the
       process. The tracer is uninstalled after the process terminates.
       
  <dt> <code>sphinx pexec <var>PATH ARGS...</var></code>
  <dd> starts <var>PATH</var> with the profiler installed for the
       process. The tracer is uninstalled after the process terminates.

<h2>Adding Systemcalls</h2>

Sphinx has some support for nonstandard systemcall extensions.
See <!--href="userappdemo.html"-->this document</a> for details.

<a name="caveats"></a>
<h2>Caveats</h2>

Here are some tricky functions.

<ul>
  <li> <b>ioctl</b><br>
       Yes, you can use ioctl. However, most of the requests are simply
       ignored. System V termio requests to the console are supported
       (like TCGETA, TCSETA, etc). See man termio.
</ul>

<h2>Problems and Future Plan</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> mobj cow now only inherits the whole memory object.
       We should change it to inherit only part if needed.
  <dt> exec coredumps when path does not exist.
       
  <dt> Sphinx.m3 is getting too big. It has to be divided.
       
  <dt> FreeBSD support
  <dd> It is still very rudimentary.
       
  <dt> Crappy terminal interface
  <dd> Some services related to the terminal don't work.
       For example, <code>^C</code> is delivered only when the process is
       executing the system call. <code>SIGIO</code> is not supported.
       I think the real reason of these problems is that the current terminal
       driver interface is synchronous; i.e., it is read/write, not
       put/get(like in System V stream). We have to switch to asynchronous
       one soon.
       
  <dt> User/group management
  <dd> How does this fit into the whole spin authorization mechanisms?
  
  <dt> <code>/dev/kmem</code>
  <dd> Alpha OSF/1 still uses this. FreeBSD seems to discourage the use of
       kmem, and instead it provides <code>sysctl(2)</code>.
       It is a system call to access kernel resources in a manner similar to
       SNMP. It will be relatively easy to support <code>sysctl</code>.

  <dt> Ad hoc conversion from exception to errno.
  <dd> It's random now.
       There are two ways to go. One is to continue doing random conversion.
       The other is to make Error.E error codes conform to UNIX errno.
       I'm inclined to latter.
       
  <dt> No certain way to signal kernel thread
       
  <dd> Our current execution model is that kernel thread is a
       sacred entity; we can't change it's state from outside.

       One problem I have is UNIX signals. To implement UNIX signal,
       you have to wake up the target process if it's in interruptible
       wait state. For example, when a process X is waiting in ttyread and
       <code>^C</code> is typed, X should be dequeued and made runnable. <p>

       The way UNIX implements this is that the signal delivery
       code looks into the current thread state, and if it's in
       interruptible wait state, the delivery code just dequeues the
       thread from whatever queue it is waiting on.<p>

       I found it's difficult to do this from M3 world.
       To make tty signal work, I added a terrible hack in tty.c.
       First, I added a field last_signal to struct tty. It is char.
       When a key that raises signal is pressed, it sets
       last_signal to be the signal number, and wakes up a thread.
       When waking up a thread for other reasons(ex, newline pressed),
       it sets last_signal to be -1.
       When thread wakes up, it checks last_signal and if it's not -1,
       it returns EINTR.<p>

       This is not a right solution, because last_signal is a global
       variable, so there is a race condition(However it would work
       in most cases because console access is arbitrated using some
       higher level protocol and there usually is only one thread waiting
       on struct tty). Another problem of this "solution" is that
       it's not generic. It works for tty, but it won't work for
       threads waiting on select, etc.
