<h1>Pelican - The SPIN Web Server</h1>

Pelican is an integrated web server that achieves high
performance through its unique design. What sets Pelican
apart from conventional servers is that it is a <i>kernel
extension</i>, i.e. it is injected into the operating system. The
operating system in question is SPIN, a new, extensible operating
system we have been developing at the University of Washington for the
last two years. SPIN provides high-performance, extensibility, and
safety to applications. By this, we mean that SPIN allows applications
to modify the operating system implementation in order to support
new functionality that they require. SPIN extensibility mechanisms
ensure that the composition does not violate overall system integrity.
(See the <a href="http://www-spin.cs.washington.edu">SPIN</a>
home page for more details).

<p>
The job of a web server is to act as a conduit between networked
clients and the data. Conventional web servers execute in their own 
separate address space, isolated from the system services that they
rely on. The SPIN web server is dynamically linked into the operating
system, and executes in the kernel's privileged address space. Since
it is physically closer to the systems it uses, it can be better
integrated with them. This close integration allows the web server to
deliver high performance.

<p>
NEED A PICTURE HERE

<p>
The server consists of two components - an HTTP 1.0 protocol engine
and a cache. The web server relies on SPIN in-kernel
sockets for its interactions with the networking layer, and on the
SPIN filesystem for locating URLs. It also uses disk extents to
implement a swap partition as a backing store for its buffer cache.

<p>
The protocol engine forms the heart of the web server. It parses
client requests and directs the splicer and the cache to satisfy the
requests. Upon reception of a request, the web server first determines
the protocol number and version being used (it supports 1.0 and is
backwards compatible with 0.9). It then logs the access and the
referer fields, and checks to see if the URL being accessed is already
in the cache. If so, it pins the blocks in the cache, and sends them
out through the networking interface. As the blocks are acknowledged,
they are unpinned so that they can be replaced when memory runs
short. If the file is not in the cache, it retrieves it from the
filesystem and sends it out. The blocks are placed in the cache as
they are sent out. The current implementation spawns off a thread for
each URL request.

<p>
The web server cache has two components - a name cache and a block
cache. The name cache provides a fast translation from a string name
provided by the client into a block list. A block list consists of a
set of blocks, which may be in memory or on secondary storage. A block
in memory directly holds the data that was stored in it. However, as
memory runs out, blocks may be swapped out to secondary storage. The
web server goes through the list of all cached files, and selects the
least frequently accessed pages for swapout. A selected page will be
swapped out in its entireity, as it is not possible to perform block
accesses through the HTTP protocol. The storage medium is represented
as a huge extent. During swapout, smaller extents that are large
enough to hold each block are allocated, and the blocks are written
out to the disk through the extents. The block headers are then
updated to hold the extent offsets for the swapped out files.

<p>
In order to reduce latency of common operations, the web server relies
on optimistic concurrency controls. In particular, no mutual exclusion
locks are acquired on any path in the server. Instead, carefully
ordered atomic quadword updates are used to synchronize with
changes to global data structures. The block cache uses a
readers/writers lock implementation that is based on atomic increment
and decrement operations. The atomic increment and decrement
operations are implemented on our current uniprocessor server 
as restartable atomic sequences. The readers/writers locks use a
heavier weight mechanism, namely semaphores, to block in the uncommon
case of contention for a lock.
