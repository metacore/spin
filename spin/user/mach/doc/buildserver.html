<h2>So you want to build the OSF/1 Unix server for SPIN</h2>

These instructions will tell you what to do.  Some steps may be unpolished
and rather ugly, but this is a starting point to allow more people to work
on the OSF/1 server.

<h3>Historical Perspective</h3>

In the dark ages, there was ODE.  This is where SPIN lived when it was
a "wart" on the side of Mach.  This is also where the OSF/1 server lived.
<p>
Since those days, SPIN has migrated to CVS.  The OSF/1 server has never
actually migrated to CVS, but it maintains partial residence there. 
That is, you still need the ODE environment to build the OSF/1 server,
but server code can be checked in and checked out using CVS.  
<p>
Although the ODE environment is often considered difficult to use, the 
server build depends on it.  For instance, thanks to ODE code-backing, you
don't have to check out the entire source tree for compiling and editing.
<p>
In the future, the OSF/1 server will most likely be migrated to
CVS.  This cannot happen until reliances on ODE functionality, such as
backing trees, are eliminated.


<h3>Making your sandbox</h3>

If you don't already have a sandbox (and hence a ~/.sandboxrc file), you
will need to run the full mksb command:
<pre>
mksb -back /afs/cs/project/spin/build/release-7 -dir /afs/cs/project/spin/{login} -m alpha {sbname}
</pre>
If you already have a ~/.sandboxrc file, you can just run
<pre>
mksb -def {sbname}
</pre>
Make sure your sandbox is backed off release-7.  Also, you will want to
choose "b" for all of the backing options.  If you do not have mksb in 
your path, use
<pre>
/afs/cs/project/spin/build/release-7/export/alpha/bin/mksb
</pre>
<p>
In order to use the ODE build tools, you will need to make some additions
to your path.  Namely, you will want the following two entries:
<pre>
/afs/cs/project/spin/{login}/{sbname}/export/alpha/bin
/afs/cs/project/spin/{login}/{sbname}/link/export/alpha/bin
</pre>
When you type "which build" at the prompt, you should see
<pre>
/afs/cs/project/spin/{login}/{sbname}/link/export/alpha/bin/build
</pre>


<h3>Setting up your sandbox for CVS</h3>

Sometime in the transition from the dark ages to the modern era, the entire
OSF/1 server was entered into CVS under the trunk "release-7".  The OSF/1 
server which runs on SPIN is a branch off this trunk.
<p>
Just as we always check out SPIN code relative to the trunk name "spin",
it is necessary to check out OSF/1 server code relative to the trunk name
"release-7".  However, the sandbox directory hierarchy is important to 
the ODE build process -- you don't want your code an extra level deep in
a "release-7" directory.  Hence,
<pre>
cd /afs/cs/project/spin/{login}/{sbname}
ln -s src release-7
</pre>


<h3>Checking out the OSF/1 server code</h3>

You will not be checking out the entire OSF/1 Unix server.  Instead, you
will be checking out a superset of those files which have been modified
in order to run the OSF/1 server on SPIN.  You will rely on the ODE code
backing mechanism to account for any source files which you do not check
out.
<p>
The files you check out are located in two major areas:
<ul>
<li>mk/user:  libmach and libcthreads.  libmach is where the most 
    significant changes have occurred.  Here, IPC messages are converted 
    into syscalls.</li>
<li>osf/server:  the bulk of the Unix server.
</ul>

Currently, you will be checking out significantly more files than you
actually need to check out (i.e. files which have not changed since the
original release-7).  There are two reasons for this excessive checkout:
<ul>
<li>No easy CVS trick has been found to locate precisely those files 
    which have changed.</li>
<li>There is still debugging information in many files which can be
    removed.</li>
</ul>
These are not difficult obstacles to overcome; they just take time and
will take effect in future releases.
<p>
The tag to use in checking out is spinux-3.  The actual checkout command is
<pre>
cd /afs/cs/project/spin/{login}/{sbname}
cvs checkout -r spinux-3 release-7/mk/user release-7/osf/server
</pre>


<h3>Building the OSF/1 Unix server for SPIN</h3>

The build has a two step process.  First, you must build libmach and
libcthreads.  If you do not, the backing libs will be used when the 
server is linked.  To build libmach and libcthreads
<pre>
cd /afs/cs/project/spin/{login}/{sbname}/src/mk/user
build
</pre>
This step should take several minutes.  Afterwards, you should have an
export/alpha/lib directory under your sandbox with libmach and libcthreads.
<p>
The second step is building the server.  This step will take much longer,
on the order of a half hour to an hour.
<pre>
cd /afs/cs/project/spin/{login}/{sbname}/src/osf/server
build
</pre>
<p>
There are a couple things to keep in mind to speed up builds:
<ul>
<li> Use a fast machine with plenty of memory (of course).</li>
<li> You can fork off multiple processes to compile files.  Use the build
     flag "-j {n}" to fork off n build processes.  Be courteous when 
     using build -j.</li>
<li> AFS will be relinked every time you build the server.  This is 
     annoying because it takes a while and you will probably never change
     it.  After you have built libafs at least once, you can specify that it
     not be built again.  To do this, edit src/osf/server/Makefile:  grep
     for the definition of SUBDIRS (approx line 70) and take out afs.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Preparing the OSF/1 Unix server for SPIN</h3>

After the build completes, you will have a server.  The server will live
under export and under obj in your sandbox.  The problem is that this 
server is unnecessarily huge since it has not been stripped.  I usually 
strip a copy of the server and place it in my project directory for easy 
tftp'ing:
<pre>
strip /afs/cs/project/spin/{login}/{sbname}/obj/alpha/osf/server/DEFAULT/vmunix.OSFSRV1.DEFAULT 
cp /afs/cs/project/spin/{login}/{sbname}/obj/alpha/osf/server/DEFAULT/vmunix.OSFSRV1.DEFAULT /afs/cs/project/spin/ddion/vmunix.OSFSRV1.DEFAULT
</pre>
Another helpful hint:  if you're going to be doing this a lot, look into 
X cut buffers.
<p>
When debugging, make sure you use vmunix.OSFSRV1.DEFAULT.unstripped.

This Web page is targeted toward using my copy of the server binary.  
Yours should fit right in.

<h3>What do you mean it doesn't work?</h3>

Please mail me bug reports, or use PRMS entry machsux.
