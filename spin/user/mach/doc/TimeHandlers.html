The TimeHandlers interface handles emulation tasks related to timing.
These include timeouts, the softclock, mapped time, and performance
measurement.
<ul>
<li><b>Timeouts:</b> The timeout mechanism makes use of the SPIN alarm
facility.  The SPIN alarm facility runs a procedure after a given amount
of time.  For timeouts, the procedure passed to the alarm interface kicks
a timeout semaphore.  The code setting the timeout then waits on that 
semaphore.  After the appropriate wait, the alarm goes off, the semaphore
is kicked, and the waiting thread continues.</li>
<li><b>Softclock:</b> The OSF/1 server softclock is built using the Mach
message interface.  Since SPIN does not provide the Mach message interface,
special system calls are provided to emulate the softclock.  The softclock
is primarily based on timeouts.  A thread drops into the kernel with a 
timeout value.  It will either be restarted by the timeout mechanism, or
it will be "poked" by another server thread.</li>
<li><b>Mapped Time:</b> The OSF/1 server accesses the current time through
a global mapped time variable.  The mapped time variable is constructed by
using device_map() to map the time device into a kernel memory location
and then vm_map() to map that kernel memory location into the server.  SPIN
supports neither of these mapping features.  Hence, a server-created thread
periodically accesses the current time through the SAL time interface and 
writes it to the server address space.</li>
<li><b>Measurement:</b> Finally, the TimeHandlers interface provides some
basic procedures to time activity in the Mach/OSF/1 emulation modules.</li>
</ul>
