The MarshallExc interface provides a means for the ExcHandlers module
to marshall syscall arguments between the OSF/1 server and SPIN.  The
basic unit of marshalling is the handle.  When an application thread
enters the ExcHandlers module with a syscall request, it first obtains
one of these handles.  It then stores all of its arguments on this
handle, kicks a server thread associated with its task, and waits on
a semaphore associated with this handle.  The server thread finds the
appropriate handle, gets the arguments and takes them up to the server.
After handling the system call, the server thread returns to the kernel
via the exception_task_get_next_exception system call.  It relocates
the marshalling handle and places the syscall resulting state on this
handle.  Finally, it kicks the application thread and waits for the
next syscall.  After being kicked, the application thread gathers the
resulting state and returns.
