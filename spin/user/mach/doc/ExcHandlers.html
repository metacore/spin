The ExcHandlers interface provides support for redirecting system calls
to the OSF/1 server.  There are two entry points to ExcHandlers: from the
OSF/1 server and from a user-level application.
<p>
The OSF/1 server drops threads into ExcHandlers using the
exception_task_get_next_exception() system call.  This system call carries
down a result state from a previous system call (if any) and waits for the
next system call.
<p>
Entry from a user-level application comes when the syscall number does
not match any in the Syscall case statement.  The syscall is then redirected
to the ExcHandlers module, a server thread is kicked.  The application
thread then waits for the server thread to return.
<p>
The ExcHandlers module relies heavily on the MarshallExc interface to 
marshall arguments.
