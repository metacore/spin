<title>The DEC OSF/1 Server Retargetting Plan</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1> Spinning a DEC OSF/1 Server</h1>

<date>November 18, 1993</date>
 <P>
 
Today, several (bershad, savage, becker, sanislo, gun) of us met to 
devise a strategy for retargetting the DEC/OSF 1
server onto the SPIN kernel.  This note describes that plan.

Jan Sanislo has agreed to do the server retargetting.  Things are somewhat
murky now because there
<UL>
<LI> is not currently a working spin kernel

<LI> nor is there even a complete set of interfaces
</UL>

 <P>
 
We decided to move ahead in a pipeline with development of both the
spin-ized server and the spin kernel occurring at more or less the same time,
but staged with the server one step ahead of the kernel.

<H2>Stage 1:  ELIMINATING MACH IPC</H2>


We eliminate the server's reliance on MACH IPC.  David's earlier
work on the emulator free server makes this possible.  We discussed three
places where the server relies on mach IPC:
<UL>
<LI>  exceptions

<LI>  the inode pager

<LI>  a few buggy device and vm "system" calls
</UL>
 <P>

	The exception machinery relies on direct IPC instead of the
	exception.defs mig stubs for performance. Exception propogation
	can be handled by straightforward system calls, vis a vis the old Taos
	Model:
		Exception.GetNextException(task, ...)
 <P>
	The inode pager is an optimization, combining text mapping and the
	buffer cache in the file server. We should be able to eliminate it by
	mapping what were once pager messages into exceptions that come from
	client applications, which are handled by virtual memory copy
	operations.
 <P>
	The buggy device and vm system calls should just get fixed. David, can
	you post a description of these bugs
	<A HREF="ipcbugs.html"> "HERE."</A>

<H2>Stage 2: ELIMINATE DEVICE*</H2>

We put all device management up into the server, eliminating all reliance on
device* functions, with the exception of device_map, which is necessary to get
the registers into the server's address space.

<P>
Important devices here are:
<UL>
<LI> 	network
<LI> 	disk (scsi)
<LI> 	keyboard
<LI> 	mouse
</UL>

 <P>
network and disk have already been done (see mapped_scsi and mapped_ether from
and older MIPS mk). The keyboard and mouse can probably be hacked around if
mapping them in general proves to be too hard initially.
 <P>
The hard problem here \may/ be the lack of a standardized DMA interface for
the disk.
 <P>
Secondary advantages are that we can integrate DEC OSF 1 source 
code from OSF 2 directly into our server.


<H2>Stage 3: ELIMINATE MACH VM</H2>

 <P>
Retarget towards the new, improved, and soon-to-be-announced SPIN VM
interface.
 <P>
During stage 1 and stage 2, we need to implement the externalized VM
interface.


<H2>Stage 4:  ELIMINATE MACH THREADS</H2>


Retarget towards the new strand (thread) interface.  This 
appears to be the trickiest, and least well understood part. (the lack of
understanding probably contributes to its perceived trickiness)
 <P>
During stage 3, we need to implement the externalized threads interface.



<H2>Summary</H2>


The idea behind the stages is that none should have any forward dependencies.

In order to keep the pipe flowing, we must start vetting the externalized
SPIN interfaces.
