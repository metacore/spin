<h1>User-Level Programs on the SPIN OSF/1 Unix Server</br></h1>
<date>Updated for spin-20: 8 April 1996</date>

<hr>

<p>

<h2>So you want to run a user-level program on SPIN</h2>

These instructions will tell you what to do.  Unfortunately, you can't
run emacs or Netscape on the SPIN server ... yet ...

<h3>Setting up your machine</h3>

The server will look for some files on the local machine as it boots.
Follow these instructions to get set up:
<dd>1.  Become superuser at the root of the filesystem.
<dd>2.  rm -rf /spinbin; cp -r /afs/cs/project/spin/ddion/spinbin .
<dd>3.  cd mach_servers
<dd>4.  mv mach_init mach_init.old
<dd>5.  ln -s /spinbin/spin_init mach_init

<h3>Setting up SPIN</h3>

As of <date>31 May 1996</date>, the OSF/1 server runs directly on 
the SPIN trunk.  Occasionally, though, by tweaking a few things in
your kernel you can improve performance and reduce irritability.
These tweaks evolve as SPIN evolves, but they often involve
<ul>
<li>SpinProgram.c: this is the file which partitions SPIN memory.
    <ul>
    <li>SpinNumPhysFreePages controls how much memory can be allocated
    through the OSF/1 server virtual memory interface.  This number
    should be high enough for the server to boot (2000 pages is
    recommended), although now that deallocate works, it is no longer
    critical to raise it as high as possible.</li>
    <li>SpinNumMallocPages controls, among other things, the amount
    of memory available for dynamic linking.  The OSF/1 server will
    require roughly 20 MB.</li>
    <li>By decreasing the above two, you increase the memory available
    for traced allocation.  In its current state, the OSF/1 server
    forces frequent kernel garbage collection.  Garbage collection
    hurts performance significantly.  By increasing traced memory, 
    the frequency of garbage collection can be reduced.
    </ul>
<li>Error messages:  occasionally error messages or debugging printfs
    are left in SPIN for development purposes.  The server does a lot
    of things a lot of times, which means you may see a lot of these
    messages.  If you work with the server often and you understand
    the conditions under which such messages are displayed, it may be
    worth the trouble to take them out.
</ul>

<p>
If you find any other problems running the server on your 
out-of-the-box kernel, please submit a bug report or contact ddion.

<h3>Setting up the UNIX system call extensions</h3>

The OSF/1 Unix extensions should build by default with other extensions.
The source is under 
<pre>
spin/user/mach
</pre>  
See the current release build notes for building extensions.

<h3>Booting the server</h3>

<dd>1.  Boot SPIN.
<dd>2.  Run the Unix init script:
        <pre>script ~/spin/scripts/unix.spininit</pre>
<dd>3.  Exec the server:
	<pre>exec -noreturn /spin/ddion/vmunix.OSFSRV1.stable</pre>
<p>
<b>Note:</b>  Do <i>NOT</i> run script -b.  What the server needs from 
script -b is subsumed by the unix.spininit script.  At this point, the 
OSF/1 server and nanny don't get along so well.  This is future work.


<h3>Using the user-level shell</h3>

Type help at the SPIN shell prompt to see your builtin options.  
<p>
The first set of programs available to you are those in /spinbin.  They are
<li>spin_init: I wouldn't recommend running this from the shell.
<li>init: debuggable version of /sbin/init (does not yet work)
<li>shell: the program currently running.
<li>ls: lists the contents of a directory.
<li>hello: simple exec test.
<li>type: displays the contents of a file.
<li>copy: tests writable file system (does not yet work)
<li>io: lib I/O test
<li>send: sends small UDP packets using the socket interface
<li>float: tests some floating point operations
<li>getpid: times a simple system call
<b>Note:</b> Upkeep of these programs is not guaranteed.  spin_init and
the shell should be current until the server switches to /sbin/init and
/sbin/sh.
<p>
The source for these programs is in /afs/cs/project/spin/ddion/spin_init/.
If you want to build your own user-level programs, start with the makefile
located here.  There are some limitations, though:
<ul>
<li>Don't do anything that would write to the disk.  The server still
thinks it has a read-only file system.
</ul>
<p>
If you discover other things to add to this list, please let me know.
As I said, simple user-level programs have not been extensively tested.
<p>
There are some additional system calls available to you.  Their main
purpose is to facilitate debugging, avoiding complicated asynchronous
console I/O.
<ul>
<li><b>sysprintd(x):</b> prints to the console x as an unsigned value, 
followed by a newline.</li>
<li><b>sysprintstr(str):</b> prints to the console the first 80 characters of 
the string str.</li>
<li><b>sysprintstrd(str, x):</b> prints to the console the first 80 characters 
of the string str, followed by the value x as an unsigned value, followed 
by a newline.</li>
<li><b>strandprintstrd(str, x):</b> prints to the console the current 
Strand.T (REF as an unsigned hex int), followed by the first 80 
characters of the string str, followed by the value x as an unsigned value, 
followed by a newline.</li>
<li><b>set_debug_switch(x):</b> toggles the syscall debugging tracing.  If x is
zero, syscall tracing is turned off (this is the default and initial
condition).  Otherwise, syscall debugging is turned on.  This means that
tracing data will be printed to the console for each system call, and 
at key points during complex system call handlers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Lately it has also been possible to run some programs in /sbin.  These
are programs which were not modified at all and have no idea they are
running over SPIN.  These programs tend to consume more memory than the
programs in /spinbin, hence the SPIN garbage collector will probably
slow things down.  Also, programs in /sbin
tend to do a lot of asynchronous console I/O.  This is fairly thread
intensive, and will increase the probability of the GC-threads bug 
popping up.
