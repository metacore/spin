The MachHandlers interface provides some of the functionality related to
Mach data structures and names.  For instance, syscalls related to port
names and access rights are supported by MachHandlers.  On the more
complex side, creation and destruction of Mach tasks is handled through
MachHandlers.
<p>
Much of the support required by syscalls in the MachHandlers interfaces 
is simply not provided in SPIN.  Although this apparent lack of 
functionality is not currently an obstacle to progress, it may be worth
reviewing in the future.
