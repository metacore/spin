<H2>Overview</H2>

The OSF/1 UNIX Server provides UNIX functionality for user-level programs
running on SPIN.  Moreover, as SPIN's most demanding client (at least so
far), it provides an excellent stress test for kernel services.  Finally, 
as the server port is being performed almost entirely via SPIN dynamically 
linked extensions, the OSF/1 server is a model of using kernel extensions 
for emulation.
<p>
The goal of the OSF/1 server is to run SPIN on desktop workstations, 
using it for day-to-day operations such as reading mail and developing
code.  In its current state, the server can be booted to single-user mode
and used to run some basic programs.

<H2>Design and Implementation</H2> 

The OSF/1 server in use was developed for the Mach microkernel.  The first
step in porting it to SPIN was the removal of reliance upon the Mach IPC 
message-passing interface.  Mach messages were either removed or converted
into system calls.  Whenever possible, these changes were localized in the
libmach library.  This conversion represents the bulk of changes to the 
OSF/1 server code.  Following are some early notes on retargeting the 
OSF/1 server for SPIN:
<ul>
<li><a href="./osf.html">Converting the OSF/1 server</a>: original notes
    on OSF/1 server conversion.</li>
<li><a href="ipcbugs.html">IPC Dependencies</a>: server dependencies on
    Mach IPC at time of original OSF/1 server conversion meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Simply transforming Mach messages into system calls did not complete the
port of the OSF/1 server to SPIN.  Although SPIN may provide some 
functionality similar to Mach, its interfaces differ substantially.
Hence, SPIN dynamically linked extensions are used to emulate a Mach
environment upon which the OSF/1 server executes.
<p>
The basic unit of emulation is the system call.  When an application makes
a system call, the Syscall event is raised in SPIN.  A dynamically linked
extension waiting for the Syscall event determines which system call has
been made and takes appropriate action.  This action could be either of the
following:
<ul>
<li>Determine that the system call is intended for the kernel (e.g. the
    Mach vm_allocate() system call).  Call upon the appropriate SPIN 
    services to satisfy the request.</li>
<li>Determine that the system call is intended for UNIX (e.g. the UNIX
    getpid() system call).  Marshall the system call arguments and 
    perform an upcall to the OSF/1 server.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hence, the SPIN OSF/1 server implementation consists of two major parts.
The first is the OSF/1 server itself.  The bulk of the OSF/1 server is
written in C and executes in the user-level.  The second consists of SPIN
dynamically linked extensions.  These extensions are written in Modula-3
and execute in the kernel.

<H2>Using the OSF/1 Unix Server</H2>

<h3>Checking out and Building</h3>

The SPIN extensions can be checked out with other SPIN extensions.  The
OSF/1 server is not so easy.  For checkout and build instructions, see
<a href="./buildserver.html">Building the OSF/1 Server for SPIN</a>.  
To simply use the OSF/1 server to run user-level programs, see
<a href="./userlevel.html">User-Level Programs on SPIN</a>.  The remainder 
of this documentation will focus on the SPIN dynamically linked extensions 
which help emulate a Mach environment for the OSF/1 server.

<h3>Interfaces</h3>

The OSF/1 server extensions consist of the following interfaces (and 
associated modules):
<ul>
<li><a href="./Syscall.html">Syscall.i3</a>
<li><a href="./Buffer.html">Buffer.i3</a>
<li><a href="./DeviceHandlers.html">DeviceHandlers.i3</a>
<li><a href="./ExcHandlers.html">ExcHandlers.i3</a>
<li><a href="./HandlerUtils.html">HandlerUtils.i3</a>
<li><a href="./MachHandlers.html">MachHandlers.i3</a>
<li><a href="./MarshallExc.html">MarshallExc.i3</a>
<li><a href="./ThreadHandlers.html">ThreadHandlers.i3</a>
<li><a href="./TimeHandlers.html">TimeHandlers.i3</a>
<li><a href="./VMHandlers.html">VMHandlers.i3</a>
<li><a href="./VMTaskSupport.html">VMTaskSupport.i3</a>
</ul>

<H2>Remaining Issues</H2>

The port of the OSF/1 Unix Server to SPIN is far from complete.  Some 
near future work includes:
<ul>
<li>Converting to the new <a href="../../vm/doc/index.html">Mach VM</a>
    dynamically linked extensions.</li>
<li>Using 
    <a href="../../../local/sieg/doc/index.html">
    Sieg</a> as much as possible for automatically generated argument
    marshalling.</li>
<li>Making the server work with the 
    <a href="../../nanny/doc/index.html">nanny</a> facility.
</ul>
