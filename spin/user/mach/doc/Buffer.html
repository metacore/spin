The Buffer interface is largely stolen from the HTTPD buffer management
scheme.  It provides a fast way of allocating memory by reusing instead
of releasing memory which is no longer needed.  In this manner, 
interaction with the allocator and interruption by the collector are
avoided when possible.

The Buffer interface is <a href="../src/Buffer.i3">Buffer.i3</a>.
