The Syscall interface and module are the main drivers behind the OSF/1
UNIX extensions.  The Syscall module consists largely of a case statement
based on syscall numbers.  Requests which are not found in the case
statement are assumed to be for the OSF/1 server.
<p>
When an appropriate syscall number is located in the case statement, a
procedure is called which handles the system call.  Currently, that 
procedure is responsible for argument marshalling.
<p>
Syscall requests are caught in as SPIN events.  At link time, the 
Syscall module registers an event handler and guard with the SPIN dispatcher.
