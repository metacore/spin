<h1>Syscall bugs that force server to use IPC</h1>

A few unfortunate IPC dependecies remain in the server.  


<H2>vm_write</H2>

<P>
mig_vm_write is called explicitly in uxkern/user_reply_msg.c
This is the copyout code to move data out to a user task in response to
a syscall or signal.  This data used to go in a reply message to the
emulator.  Without an emulator we have to stuff it in the user task with
vm_write.  

<P>
vm_write usually moves data in PAGESIZE chunks but thats not the case
with copyout.  A bcopy in syscall_vm_write gets a dreaded "Bad Access"
exception trying to move small message.  As of August, syscall_vm_write
was <UL> not </UL> the same function as mig_vm_write.  mig_vm_write
didn't choke on the small write so that is how the no-emulatore server
got finished.
I think mef did something to optimize bcopy since August so I do not
know the current state of vm_write.

<P>
Todo: Rationalize the vm_read/write code so the syscall version can be
used rather than the IPC version.

<H2>device_*</H2>


<P>
savage says some of the device_ calls only exist in IPC form.  If so,
syscall versions need to be added to MK.  I suspect the device_*_inband
calls.  Ask savage.
