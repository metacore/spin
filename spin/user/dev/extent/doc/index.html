<H1>Disk Extents</H1>

<P>The disk <strong>extent</strong> module implements a low level disk
manager that safely space-multiplexes disks.</P>

<P>An new extent can be created from scratch using the
<strong>mkdev</strong> command.  Alternatively, a new extent can be
created by allocating a new object.  E.g.,
<strong>extent:=NEW(Extent.T).init("rz3a",32768,0)</strong> creates a
new extent on the rz3a device spanning 32KB.  This is done to obtain
the very first extent object that spans an entire device.  It is also
possible to create child extents, one that is contained within extent,
by passing the name of the partent extent to the init routine.  E.g.,
childextent:=NEW(Extent.T).init("extent_rz3a",16384,0) creates a new
extent on the extent_rz3a device spanning 16KB.</P>

<P>One can read and write to the disk via the read/write interface
inherited from the Disk.T device object.</P>

<P>An extent can be shared between nontrusting parties.  The object
acts as a capability.  To reserve a portion of a larger extent in
order to hand it out to a third party, use the allocate
method. Using this interface alone, multiple nontrusting parties
can share a device, knowing that none of them can read or write
each others' data.</P>

<P>Both size and offset values used by the read/write/init routines
are in bytes.</P>
