<H1>SPIN name server and file system extensions</H1>

SPIN tries to integrate generic name service and file systems.  The
Spincore <a href="../../kernel/spincore/src/auth/doc/NameServer.html">
name server</a> module provides a generic graph-structured name space.

<P>
The SPIN <CODE>NameServer.T</CODE> type defines a basic directory
object with which one can represent directory nodes for file systems.
Using the <CODE>NameServer.T</CODE> as the super type of file
system directories allows us to use common file system tools,
such as <CODE>ls</CODE> and <CODE>cat</CODE>, to list objects
in the global name space in addition to the file system name space.

<p>
The <A HREF="../fscore/doc/FileSystem.html">FileSystem</A> module
is the top-level manager for all file systems.
The SPIN file system is a subsystem of spin space. Thus, in theory,
it supports all the operations provided by the
<a href="../../kernel/spincore/src/auth/doc/NameServer.html">
basic name server</a> (though, some of the operations may raise exceptions
if a particular file system is not powerful enough to support them).
In addition, it provides the
interface to register and deregister, mount and unmount file system.
It also provides an interface to get the current root file system
directory.

<H1>Standard name hierarchy</h1>

How do the SPIN global name space and the file system name space fit
together? There are two different "root"s in the system; the
<dfn>global root</dfn> and the <dfn>file system root</dfn>. It turns
out that the file system root is a subdirectory of the global root
directory.

<p> The global root contains two directories, <code>svc</code> and
<code>fs</code>. The <code>svc</code> directory is used to hold SPIN
internal names such as domain names and <a
href="../../nanny/doc/index.html">nanny</a> placeholder.

<p> The <code>fs</code> directory is the root of the file system, and
it is written as "<code>/</code>".  Passing
<code>FileSystem.Lookup</code> with "<code>/</code>" returns the file
system root.  To get the global root, use "<code>/..</code>" (for
example, <code>/../svc/domains</code>).

<p>There is a similar but slightly different lookup procedure called
NameServer.Lookup. They differ only in the root directory from which
traversal starts.  <code>NameServer.LookupName</code> traverses the
name from "<code>/..</code>" (aka global root), and
<code>FileSystem.LookupName</code> traverses the name from
"<code>/</code>" (aka file system root).

<p>To avoid confusion resulting from having two different roots, it is
strongly recommended that "<code>/..</code>" is used to represent the
global root even in <code>NameServer.LookupName</code>(note:
<code>..</code> in the global root points to itself).

<p>Below are some of the standard directories used in SPIN.

<dl>
  <dt> /../svc/domains
  <dd> This directory contains the list of domains installed on the system.
  <dt> /../svc/fs
  <dd> This directory contains the list of file systems
       installed on the system.
  <dt> /../svc/devices
  <dd> This directory contains the list of devices installed on the system.
  <dt> /../svc/nanny
  <dd> Nanny aliases are installed here.
  <dt> /../fs/
  <dd> This is also known as "<code>/</code>". This is the file system root.
  <dt> /../fs/proc
  <dd> Contains information about SPIN status. I think this should be
       moved to <code>/..</code>.
</dl>

<h1>To do list</h1>

<ul>
  <li> Mount mechanism is broken. First, it doesn't handle
       ".." from the mount root. Next, it doesn't allow mounting
       file systems on non-tmpfs file systems.

       <p>Mount code should be moved to spincore, and we should do
       more traditional mount table lookup (as in bsd).

  <li> Got rid of the ad-hoc Directory.T caching.
  <li> CharArray module is separated into the FastBuffer extension.
