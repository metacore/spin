<H2>Overview</H2>

Web file system(<dfn>WFS</dfn> from now on) is a
<!href="fs"><a href="../../../user/fs/doc/index.html">file system</a> that
retrieves files from remote httpd server.
It may be slow because it provides no caching, and it sets up
TCP connection with the httpd server every time a file is being read.
The virtue of WFS is that it's simple, reliable, and easy to maintain.

<H2>Design and Implementation</H2> 

It's an another kind of <!href="fs"><a href="../../../user/fs/doc/index.html">file system</a> extension.
It defines <!href="FileSystem.i3"><a href="../fscore/src/FileSystem.i3">FileSystem.T</a>,
<!href="FileSystem.i3>FileSystem.MountPoint</a>
and <!href="File.i3"><a href="../fscore/src/File.i3">File.T</a> objects as usual,

In reponse to <code>File.T.read(<var>path</var>)</code> call, it sends out a
http request

<pre>
GET /<var>path</var>
</pre>

to the server specified when the file system in mounted.

<H2>Using the service</H2>

WFS is usually loaded via <!href="nanny"><a href="../../../user/nanny/doc/index.html">nanny</a>, so
no special command is required to load it.
When WFS is loaded, it installs inself in the
<!href="ns"><a href="../../../user/ns/doc/index.html">name server</a>. <p>

To use the file system, you first have to mount it like below.

<pre>
!>mount www.cs.washington.edu wfs /wfs
</pre>

The first argument to <code>mount</code> specifies the remote httpd server
to which WFS send out requests.

<H2>Caveats</H2> 

<ul>
  <li> It's read only.
  <li> It doesn't support directory operations.
       You can't do <code>ls</code>.
</ul>
