<H2>Overview</H2>

Unix Fast File System(<dfn>UFS</dfn> from now on) is a
<strong>readonly</strong>
<!href="fs"><a href="../../../user/fs/doc/index.html">file system</a> that
can read common ufs file system on a local disk.


<H2>Design and Implementation</H2> 

It's an another kind of <!href="fs"><a href="../../../user/fs/doc/index.html">file system</a> extension.

It's a full fledged file system except that you can't write on it.

It has extensive block cache and inode cache. The performance is
comparable to the DEC OSF/1 UFS file system.  (about 15% slower with
warm cache, almost same performance with cold cache).

<blockquote>
Note : I'm kind of cheating on caches. It's 2-way set associative with LRU
purging on each line. We should implement full associative one.
</blockquote>

<H2>Using the service</H2>

UFS is usually loaded via <!href="nanny"><a href="../../../user/nanny/doc/index.html">nanny</a>, so
no special command is required to load it.
When UFS is loaded, it installs inself in the
<!href="ns"><a href="../../../user/ns/doc/index.html">name server</a>. <p>

To use the file system, you first have to mount it like below.

<pre>
!>mount rz3a ufs /usr
</pre>

The first argument to <code>mount</code> specifies the local device name.
You can see the list of device names by

<pre>
!>show devices
</pre>

<H2>Caveats</H2> 

<ul>
  <li> It's read only.
</ul>
