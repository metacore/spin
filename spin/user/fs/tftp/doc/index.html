<H2>Overview</H2>

TFTP file system(<dfn>TFTPFS</dfn> from now on) is a
<!href="fs"><a href="../../../../user/fs/doc/index.html">file system</a> that
uses tftp(trivial ftp) protocol to retrieve a file.
It uses the tftp code provided by SAL, so
no extra network support extensions are needed.<p>

TFTPFS is a static extension(it's loaded when system boots), and
it is automatically mounted on <code>/</code> on system startup.<p>

It is currently the primary mean to load extensions into the system.<p>

TFTPFS uses low level SAL code for networking.
On SAL based on DEC OSF/1, tftp is implemented by
polling, and this means that the whole system stops
working while you are transfering a file using tftp.
And, tftp sometimes gets hung.<p>

Because of these problems, many people think using TFTP as a file
system is not the right thing to do, so we are planning
to switch to <!href="nfs.html"><a href="../../../../user/fs/nfs/doc/index.html">NFS</a> soon.<p>

<H2>Using the service</H2>

TFTPFS is mounted on <code>/</code> at the system startup.

<H2>Caveats</H2> 

<ul>
  <li> It's read only.
  <li> It doesn't support directory operations.
       You can't do <code>ls</code>.
</ul>
