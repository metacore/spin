(*
  This module defines UNIX FFS superblock structures and friends.


  Each disk drive contains some number of file systems.
  A file system consists of a number of cylinder groups.
  Each cylinder group has inodes and data.
 
  A file system is described by its super-block, which in turn
  describes the cylinder groups.  The super-block is critical
  data and is replicated in each cylinder group to protect against
  catastrophic loss.  This is done at `newfs' time and the critical
  super-block data does not change, so the copies need not be
  referenced further unless disaster strikes.
 
  For file system fs, the offsets of the various blocks of interest
  are given in the super block as:
 | 	[fs->fs_sblkno]		Super-block
 | 	[fs->fs_cblkno]		Cylinder group block
 | 	[fs->fs_iblkno]		Inode blocks
 | 	[fs->fs_dblkno]		Data blocks
  The beginning of cylinder group cg in fs, is given by
  the "cgbase(fs, cg)" macro.
 
  The first boot and super blocks are given in absolute disk addresses.
  The byte-offset forms are preferred, as they don't imply a sector size.

CONST BBSIZE = 8192;
CONST SBSIZE = 8192;
CONST BBOFF = 0;
CONST SBOFF = BBOFF + BBSIZE;
CONST BBLOCK = 0;
CONST SBLOCK = BBLOCK + BBSIZE DIV FileDefs.DEV_BSIZE;

(*
  Addresses stored in inodes are capable of addressing fragments
  of `blocks'. File system blocks of at most size MAXBSIZE can
  be optionally broken into 2, 4, or 8 pieces, each of which is
  addressible; these pieces may be DEV_BSIZE, or some multiple of
  a DEV_BSIZE unit.
 
  Large files consist of exclusively large data blocks.  To avoid
  undue wasted disk space, the last data block of a small file may be
  allocated as only as many fragments of a large block as are
  necessary.  The file system format retains only a single pointer
  to such a fragment, which is a piece of a single large block that
  has been divided.  The size of such a fragment is determinable from
  information in the inode, using the ``blksize(fs, ip, lbn)'' macro.
 
  The file system records space availability at the fragment level;
  to determine block availability, aligned fragments are examined.
 
  The root inode is the root of the file system.
  Inode 0 can't be used for normal purposes and
  historically bad blocks were linked to inode 1,
  thus the root inode is 2. (inode 1 is no longer used for
  this purpose, however numerous dump tapes make this
  assumption, so we are stuck with it)
 *)
CONST ROOTINO = 2;               (* i number of all roots *)

CONST MINBSIZE = 4096;
(*
  MINBSIZE is the smallest allowable block size.
  In order to insure that it is possible to create files of size
  2^32 with only two levels of indirection, MINBSIZE is set to 4096.
  MINBSIZE must be big enough to hold a cylinder group block,
  thus changes to (struct cg) must keep its size within MINBSIZE.
  Note that super blocks are always of size SBSIZE,
  and that both SBSIZE and MAXBSIZE must be >= MINBSIZE.
 *)

CONST MAXMNTLEN = 512;
(*
  The path name on which the file system is mounted is maintained
  in fs_fsmnt. MAXMNTLEN defines the amount of space allocated in
  the super block for this name.
  The limit on the amount of summary information per file system
  is defined by MAXCSBUFS. It is currently parameterized for a
  maximum of two million cylinders.
 *)

CONST MAXCSBUFS = 32;

(*
  "csumT" defines Per cylinder group information; summarized in blocks allocated
  from first cylinder group data blocks.  These blocks have to be
  read in from fs_csaddr (size fs_cssize) in addition to the
  super block.
 
 N.B. sizeof(csumT) must be a power of two in order for
 the ``fs_cs'' macro to work (see below).

(*
  A directory consists of some number of blocks of DIRBLKSIZ
  bytes, where DIRBLKSIZ is chosen such that it can be transferred
  to disk in a single atomic operation (e.g. 512 bytes on most machines).
 
  Each DIRBLKSIZ byte block contains some number of directory entry
  structures, which are of variable length.  Each directory entry has
  a struct direct at the front of it, containing its inode number,
  the length of the entry, and the length of the name contained in
  the entry.  These are followed by the name padded to a 4 byte boundary
  with null bytes.  All names are guaranteed null terminated.
  The maximum length of a name in a directory is MAXNAMLEN.
 
  The macro DIRSIZ(dp) gives the amount of space required to represent
  a directory entry.  Free space in a directory is represented by
  entries which have dp->d_reclen > DIRSIZ(dp).  All DIRBLKSIZ bytes
  in a directory block are claimed by the directory entries.  This
  usually results in the last entry in a directory having a large
  dp->d_reclen.  When entries are deleted from a directory, the
  space is returned to the previous entry in the same directory
  block by increasing its dp->d_reclen.  If the first entry of
  a directory block is free, then its dp->d_ino is set to 0.
  Entries other than the first in a directory do not normally have
  dp->d_ino set to 0.
