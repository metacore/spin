<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>

<p>The file data cache stores recently accessed file data in pages 
of <a href="../../../../kernel/spincore/src/memory/doc/index.html">
physical memory</a>.  It can 
potentially cache data for any file system.  It provides an easy
interface by which any file system can add, delete, read, and write 
cached files.  The default implementation of the cache uses a global
LRU policy to choose victim blocks for replacement.  However, the
replacement mechanism is implemented with events that can be caught
and handled to define different replacment schemes.  Although mapping
is not yet implemented, the cache is designed to provide a mappable 
memory object per cached file.  In this initial implementation, all
physical pages of memory are pinned -- <i>the cache is not paged</i>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="implcomponents">Implementation Components</a></h2>

The following is a description of the components that make up the
cache implementation.  It is organized by module/interface name.
<ul>

<li><a name="filedatacache"><a href="../src/FileDataCache.i3">
FileDataCache</a>: the external
interface to the cache.  <b>FileDataCache</b> allows clients to 
interact with the cache using a file-like interface.  <b>FileDataCache</b>
carries out file system requests by dividing the region to be accessed 
into cache blocks and then calling 
<a href="filemobjcache">per-file</a> access methods for those blocks.</li>

<li><a name="buffer"><a href="../src/Buffer.i3">Buffer</a>: the 
container for pages of data. <b>Buffer</b> encapsulates 
<a href="../../../../kernel/spincore/src/memory/doc/index.html">physical
pages of memory</a>.  <b>Buffer</b>s are analogous to cache blocks.  
<b>Buffer</b> is a subtype of <a href="#doublelist">DoubleList.EltT</a>, 
allowing it to easily be stored in linked lists.
<b>Buffer</b>s are the basic unit of allocation, deallocation, and 
replacement in the cache.</li>

<li><a name="basemobjcache"><a href="../src/BaseMObjCache.i3">
BaseMObjCache.i3</a>: the container for unallocated 
<a href=#buffer>buffers</a>.  Initially, all buffers are stored in the
<b>BaseMObjCache</b>.  As file data is cached, these buffers are allocated
to <a href="#filemobjcache">per-file containers</a>.  When files abandon
allocated buffers, they are returned to the free pool in the 
<b>BaseMObjCache</b>.</li>

<li><a name="filemobjcache"><a href="../src/FileMObjCache.i3">
FileMObjCache.i3</a>: the per-file container for <a href="#buffer">buffers</a>.
When a file is <a href="#filedatacache">added</a> to the cache, a 
<b>FileMObjCache</b> object is created.  The <b>FileMObjCache</b> maintains 
the buffers for a file along with any metadata for the file (e.g. size, 
backing file system, etc.) and buffer (e.g. locks, offset into file, etc.).
This data is maintained in an array of <i>block descriptors</i>.</li>

<li><a name="victim"><a href="../src/Victim.i3">Victim.i3</a>: controls
cache block replacement.  <b>Victim</b> exports an interface to control
<a href="#buffer">cache block</a> replacement.  <b>Victim</b> tracks all
allocated buffers.  Whenever a buffer is accessed, <b>Victim</b> is 
notified by the <a href="#filemobjcache">per-file</a> container.  When 
new data must be cached and no buffers are available in the 
<a href="#basemobjcache">free pool</a>, the file container asks <b>Victim</b>
to steal a block.  <b>Victim</b> then causes a file container to release
an allocated buffer.  It chooses the file container and the buffer based
on the reported access patterns.  The default implementation of <b>Victim</b>
is a global LRU strategy.  However, the <b>Victim</b> interface was designed
so that its events could be interposed and different schemes could be 
developed.</li>

<li><a name="doublelist"><a href="../src/DoubleList.i3">DoubleList.i3</a>:
implements a doubly-linked list, providing <i>O(1)</i> insertion and 
deletion.  <b>DoubleList</b>s are used to maintain the 
<a href="#basemobjcache">free pool</a>, as well as in the default 
implementation of <a href="#victim">Victim</a> to maintain the LRU list.  
Members of <b>DoubleList</b>s must be subtypes of <b>DoubleList.EltT</b>, 
such as <a href="#buffer">buffers</a>.  Although
<a href="#filemobjcache">FileMObjCache.T</a>s are not subtypes of 
<b>DoubleList.EltT</b>, they contain a public <b>DoubleList.EltT</b>
subtype field that allows them to be inserted (somewhat awkwardly) into 
<b>DoubleList</b>s.  Although this functionality is not used, it may be
helpful in a dynamically installed implementation of 
<a href=#victim">Victim</a>.  Both FileMObjCache.T and BaseMObjCache.T 
contain <b>DoubleList</b> fields, providing for easily accessible per-file
or per-cache lists.</li>

</ul>

<hr>

<h2><a name="locks">Locking</a></h2>

The cache locking scheme can be somewhat confusing.  The expected locks
are present to avoid data races when multiple threads access 
<a href="#doublelist">DoubleList</a>s as well as the 
file-to-<a href="#filemobjcache">FileMObjCache table in
<a href="#filedatacache">FileDataCache.m3</a>.  FileMObjCache, however,
has a more interesting locking scheme.  FileMObjCache locks are on 
three levels:

<ul>

<li>Block: there is a <a href="../../../sync/rwlock/src/ReaderWriterLock.i3">
ReaderWriterLock</a> associated with each <a href="#filemobjcache">block
descriptor</a>.  ReaderLocks allow multiple readers and no writers, while
WriterLocks allow only a single writer.  ReaderLocks must be obtained
when the data or metadata of a block is being read.  WriterLocks must be
obtained when the data or metadata of a block is being written, and if the
block is being swapped in or swapped out.  Holding a ReaderLock or WriterLock
does not inhibit access to other blocks in the file.</li>

<li>File Metadata: there is a MUTEX associated with each 
<a href="#filemobjcache">FileMObjCache.T</a>.  This MUTEX is used to 
protect against concurrent access to the metadata associated with a file
(including size, number of resident pages, number of hits and misses, etc.).
The MUTEX must be grabbed when reading or writing file metadata.  It should
not be held while, e.g., swapping out a block.   In fact, holding the MUTEX
does not prevent access to blocks.</li>

<li>File Access: there is a monitor-like object associated with each 
<a href="#filemobjcache">FileMObjCache.T</a>.  It can be used to restrict
access to the entire file, such as to delete it from the cache or 
restructure its array of block descriptors.  This lock allows for multiple
readers and writers unless access is explicitly disallowed.  When access is 
explicitly disallowed, any ongoing accesses can run to completion.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="fs">File Systems</a></h2>

<p>There are two obstacles to caching a file system.  The first is 
ensuring that file objects are of the proper type, and the second is 
ensuring that the cache is interposed between the file system and the
disk (or other storage device).</p>

<p>File objects must be of the proper type because of the cache's reliance
on Modula-3 
<a href="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/m3sources/html/table/src/Table.ig.html">table generic</a>.  A table is used in 
<a href="#filedatacache">FileDataCache</a> to translate from a file system
<a href="../../fscore/doc/index.html">File.T</a> object to a 
<a href="#filemobjcache">FileMObjCache.T</a> object.  Since File.T is the
table key, the <a href="../../fscore/src/File.i3">File.i3</a> interface
must have a Hash() and Equal() procedure.  The File.i3 does not have these
procedures.  Instead, the File.T object has a public datafield of type
<a href="../../fscore/src/FileId.i3">FileId.T</a>, and the 
<a href="../../fscore/src/FileId.i3">FileId.i3</a> interface does have
Hash() and Equal() procedures.  Unfortunately, my experiences have 
indicated that the FileId field does not provide unique identification
for files (for some file systems, every file had a FileId field consisting
entirely of zeroes).</p>

<p>There are many approaches to fixing the file type problem.  A few are
suggested below:</p>

<ul>

<li>The first approach is the one currently in use (although not checked
into the potato).  The cache implementation provides the 
<a href="../src/CacheFile.i3">CacheFile</a> object whose 
interface defines Hash() and Equal() procedures.  A CacheFile.T is 
a File.FileT with the additional methods hash() and equal().  The Hash()
and Equal() procedures simply call these methods (hence they can be 
overridden in subtypes).  No other File.FileT methods are overridden in
the CacheFile.T object.  

<p>All files stored in the cache must be subtypes of CacheFile.T.  
Cacheable file systems can be created easily by modifying existing file
systems, subtyping the FileT object from CacheFile.T rather than
<a href="../../fscore/src/File.i3">File.FileT</a>.  One example is the 
CacheUFS file system in <tt>/spin/ddion/spin/user/fs/cufs</tt>.</p></li>

<li>The second approach also involves the 
<a href="../src/CacheFile.i3">CacheFile</a> object.  In this case, 
though, rather than subtyping CacheFile.T from the
<a href="../../fscore/src/File.i3">File.FileT</a> object, File.FileT
would be a subtype of CacheFile.T.  That way, all file systems can
be cacheable by default.</li>

<li>The third approach is to fix 
<a href="../../fscore/src/FileId.i3">FileId</a>. This would
        remove the need for the Hash() and Equal() procedures in
        the <a href="../src/CacheFile.i3">CacheFile</a>
        interface.Rather than use a table mapping CacheFile.Ts to
        FileMObjCache.Ts, the cache implementation would use a
        mapping from FileId.Ts to FileMObjCache.Ts.</li>

</ul>

<p>There are also several approaches to interposing the cache
into the filing service. A few are suggested below:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The first approach is currently in use and corresponds to
        the first approach to fixing the file type problem above.
        The file system to be cached is copied. Its existing
        read() and write() methods are used as the swapin and
        swapout parameters to AddFile() in the 
<a href="../src/FileDataCache.i3">FileDataCache</a>
        interface.The read() and write() methods are then
        replaced with methods that invoke cache routines. An
        example of this approach is the CacheUFS file system in <tt>/spin/ddion/spin/user/fs/cufs</tt>.</li>
    <li>A second approach is much more efficient in its code
        reuse. Rather than copying an entire file system, a new 
<a href="../../fscore/src/File.i3">File</a> object can be
        created that is a subtype of the File object of the file
        system being cached. The read() and write() methods can
        be overridden to invoke the cache, and the supertype
        read() and write() methods can be used as the swapin and
        swapout parameters to AddFile().</li>
    <li>A third approach uses the 
<a href="../../../../kernel/spincore/src/dispatch/doc/index.html">dispatcher</a>
        to interpose on the read() and write() methods of a file,
        inserting calls to the cache. Unfortunately, this
        approach is not yet possible since the dispatcher is
        unable to interpose on object methods.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="commands">Commands</a></h2>

<p>The cache implementation comes with a shell interface.  Currently,
the shell commands are very limited.  A collection of cache
statistics is available with the command:<br>
<tt>cache stat</tt><br>
at the <i>SPIN</i> shell.  In order to keep statistics, the KeepStats
constant must be TRUE at compile time.

<hr>

<h2><a name="todo">Todo List</a></h2>

<p>There are a number of enhancements that would improve the file data
cache implementation.  These are not limited to the following:

<ul>
<li><b>Invalidation by timeout:</b>  Sometimes a block of data should
be invalidated or refreshed after a period of time.  NFS is an example
of a file system that invalidates its cache with timeouts.  Incorporating
timeouts into the cache implementation would not be difficult.  In fact,
since the <i>SPIN</i> kernel provides an interface to setting alarms, it
would be quite easy.  Timeouts could be implemented directly into the 
default cache, with the timeout value set as a parameter to the AddFile()
call.  Alternatively, and preferably, timeouts could be implemented 
entirely through the Victim interface.  By interposing a new Victim 
implementation via event-handling, a timeout mechanism could be dynamically
installed.  The timer would begin when the alloc buffer event is raised.
It would be cleared at each ref event.  If the alarm fires, the Victim
module could cause the FileMObjCache module to release the offending buffer.</li>

<li><b>Asynchronous Flushes:</b>  In the currently implementation, writes
are stored in the cache until the block is purged or the flush() method is
invoked.  A more interesting approach would be to provide an asynchronous
flush.  This would allow a flush to be invoked frequently without hurting
the latency of file operations.</li>

<li><b>Cleanup file containers:</b>  FileMObjCache.T objects currently are
not cleaned up.  Once AddFile() is called, FileMObjCache.T objects live in
the cache table until they are explicity deleted.  This is an unnecessary
waste of memory.  An alternate approach would be to move FileMObjCache.T
objects into an alternate data structure once they have no resident pages.
If this alternate structure reaches a certain threshold, FileMObjCache.T
objects are purged and picked up by the kernel garbage collector.  The
alternate data structure could be a doubly-linked list.  FileMObjCache.T
objects contain a DoubleList.EltT field that enables them to belong to a
list structure.  The list could be ordered by least recently abandoned, 
making the victim choice clear.</li>

</ul>
