<h2>Overview of cleaner</h2>

Eric Christoffersen, 10/14/96<p>

The cleaner is currently invoked by the user.  It should be invoked by a separate thread.

	The cleaner should be run whenever the file system has been 
inactive for 2 seconds or so.  Someone is going to tell it to run, the 
cleaner will then grab a lock on the fs.  While this lock is held, the 
filesystem is unavailable for other users.  This means that the 
cleaner had better not need exclusive access for too long.<p>
	After the cleaner is run, it tries to clean a single segment.  After 
it is through with this segment, it checks to see if anyone is waiting 
for the file system.  If not, the cleaner enters a loop of cleaning 
segments, then checking for use.  If, when the cleaner checks, 
someone is found waiting for the file system, then it immediately 
surrenders the file system lock and goes back to sleep.<p>
	The cleaner must have a way to find out if someone else wants to 
use the FS.  I propose that there be a timer thread.  Whenever the 
file system is accessed for read or write, a signal is sent to reset the 
timer.  If the timer elapses the cleaner is wakes up and grabs a lock 
on the entire file system. Noone can read or write to the file system 
until this lock has been given up.  The Seltzer paper lists times of 1.6 
seconds for the worst case, and average case cleaning times of .5 
seconds per segment.  This number can be reduced by having the 
cleaner check for file system requests while cleaning, and yielding the
file system.  This might would lower the potential cleaner wait time, but
would also result in the cleaner loosing work.<p>

The cleaning procedure must work as follows:<p>

Cleaner assumes that the write buffer has a segment available 
on which to write its data.<br>
If not then the disk is full and it should just abort.<p>

<h3>To Clean a particular segment:</h3><p>

<pre>
a) Load Segment's Segment Descriptor

b) Loop through segment descriptor, for each entry in
   descriptor, get inum and blocknum

    1.  Load the inode that the inum refers to

    2. Verify Block's Life Status:
        a.) Ask inode if the block's diskAddress is refered
            to by data at blocknum.
        b.) If not, ask inode if block's diskAddress is
            refered to by inode's meta-data.

    3. If block is alive:
        a.) Store inode number and file block number in
            INodeInfoArray.
        b.) Increment segment's life count.

c) Determine if segment is dirty enough to require cleaning, if it is:

    1.  Loop through entries in INodeInfoArray, for each entry:
        a.) Note where next block will be written.
        b.) Write data block to file system segment buffer.
        c.)Store block's new location in INodeInfoArray

    2.  Tell each inode in turn where its new blocks are.

d) Notify the free segment list that a segment has been cleaned

<h3>Structures Needed by Cleaner:</h3>

System Structures:<br>

<b>IMap:</b> LFS Array that maps inode number to segment and 
block on disk where Inode is currently stored.<p>

<b>LFS Write Buffer:</b> A segment of memory that will be written
to disk when it becomes full.  This is a system-wide segment and
ALL writes of data to disk go through it.<p>

<b>Segment Descriptor:</b> This is an array, each element 
represents a block in the segment. 
For each block it stores the inode that contained this 
block and write time, and this block's position in the file at write time.<p>

<b>Free Segment List:</b> Is used by the system to find the next segment to write to. If this 
list is empty then the file system is too busy/full and the cleaner is forced into action, 
to run until a segment is freed.<p>

<h3>Cleaner Structures:</h3>
<b>Live block counter:</b> An integer, incremented when live blocks 
are found. Is used after the cleaner's segment scan to 
determine if the particular segment is ripe for cleaning.<p>

<b>INode Info Array:</b> When the cleaner finds a block the iNode
that allegedly points to that block must be loaded into memory
in order to verify the status of 
the block (dead or alive). If the block is alive, it will be 
copied to the segment buffer and the block's inode will need to
be re-written to disk later, at the end of the segment cleaning session.
In the mean time, the cleaner needs a way to store inode blocks that
need to be modified and re-written.<br>
This structure is a sorted array, where elements are sorted by
iNumber and then by file block offset.  When the cleaner has finished
with a segment, it passes each modified iNode the section of the array
that contains the block numbers that that iNode needs to modify.  The
array passed to the iNode is sorted so that the iNode can modify in
reverse order, this is required so that the iNode indirect blocks don't
need to be traversed so often.<p>


<pre>
<b>Disk Superblock:</b>
Needs to store:
    Segments on disk
    Blocks in Segment
    Bytes in Block
    Start of first segment on disk

<b>IFile:</b>
Needs to store:
    Last written free-list
    Last written Imap
    Last written segment
    Last written block in last written segment
    Last cleaned segment

<b>Free-list:</b>
Needs to store:
    Segments that are clean and ready to be reused.
    Segments that are dirty and need to have sync called
    Segments that are stored behind a sync

    To do this, free-list is three lists, segments numbers
    are moved from list to list as they are cleaned, written to,
    or synced.
