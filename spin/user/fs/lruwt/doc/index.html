<h1>LRU-WT file system</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

The LRU-WT file system is a <a href="stack.html">stackable</a> file
system that provides a least-recently-used write-through (LRU-WT)
cache to any SPIN file system.

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

It doesn't, yet.

<h2>How <i>will</i> it work, then?</h2>

In the current design, you will mount a LRU-WT file system much like
any other file system, only instead of giving it the name of a
physical device to mount, you give it the name of a directory to
"stack" onto.

<p>

For example, typing 
<code>
mount lruwt /cache /sampledir 
</code>
will create a LRU-WT file system at <tt>cache</tt>.  It will be
stacked on the directory <tt>sampledir</tt>.  You can then bang away
at <tt>cache</tt> to your heart's content.  It will attempt to satisfy
all read requests from its memory pool.  If it can't, it will pass the
request on to <tt>sampledir</tt> and stash the answer away in the cache.
