What is a stackable file system?

<p>

A stackable file system is a file system that doesn't communicate
directly with a device such as a disk or a network interface.
Instead, it will use another file system interface to handle all
read/write/lookup requests.

<p>

The theory is a stackable file system can be used to provide
incremental functionality to existing file systems, such as adding
caching, transparent encryption, or (perhaps) compression.
