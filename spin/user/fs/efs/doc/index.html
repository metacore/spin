<H2>Overview</H2>

EFS is a <a href="../../doc/index.html">file system</a> interface to
the <a href="../../../dev/extent/doc/index.html">extent</a>.
It provides a flat, persistent naming on the extent block.
All the files on the EFS occupy contiguous blocks on the disk.

<p>
EFS is mainly used for <a href="../../../vm/doc/index.html">swapping</a>.

<a name="design"></a>
<H2>Design and Implementation</H2>

<p>
Each mount point of EFS uses a single local disk partition, much like
other file systems. EFS uses the first 8192 bytes of the partition
as the metadata region. The metadata records what files are located
where. Since the size of metadata is fixed, the maximum number of
files on a partition is also fixed.

All the files occupy contiguous blocks on the disk, and although EFS
supports file resizing, it is very inefficient. So you might want to
fix the size of a file right after it is created.

<a name="using"></a>
<H2>Using the service</H2>

Since EFS is a file system, it is mounted in the usual way.

<pre>
mount <var>extentdev</var> efs <var>directory</var>
</pre>

In the above, <var>extentdev</var> is an
<a href="../../../dev/extent/doc/index.html">extent</a> device name
that is created beforehand. <var>directory</var> is a
path that points to a preexisting directory.

Below is an example.

<pre>
extent mkdev rz3a efsextent -size 167772160
newfs efs efsextent
mkdir /efs
mount efs efsextent /efs
touch /efs/swap
mkfile /efs/swap 8388608
</pre>

<h3>Reading and Writing</h3>

Once a file is created, it can be read and written
(yes, it's writable!) using the <a href="../../doc">file system methods</a>.

<p>
The read/write position and size <em>must</em> be multiple of
the disk block size(usually 512 bytes). 

<p>
The overhead of file system methods versas direct extent manipulation is
just one procedure call, so you usually don't have to care about it.
However, if you want to save that teeny overhead, use
<a href="../src/EFS.i3">getExtent</a> method defined on
<code>EFS.T</code> object, which is a subtype of
<a href="../../fscore/src/File.i3"><code>File.T</code></a>.
