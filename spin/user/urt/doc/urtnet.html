<H1>URT Network Support</H1>

The Unix Runtime support for networking implements the interface to
the Digital Unix V3.2 networking code.  This document describes the
socket support, internet initialization utilities, and how we spoof
the Digital Unix TCP code to work in SPIN.

<H2>Sockets</H2>

<P>The URT network support provides a unix-like 
<A HREF="../net/src/Socket.i3">socket</A> interface to the UDP and TCP
protocols.  Sockets are based on the BSD socket implemention provided
by Digital Unix. The module is a safe interface to the underlying
socket implementation.  It is written defensively and does not expose
the socket represention to untrusted clients.  Sockets grants access
to the sockets layer by exporting procedures that use those of the
in-kernel UNIX system. Thus, Sockets mainly calls these procedures.
Currently we only support sockets in synchronous mode, which means
that a receive call actually blocks, if there is no data available.
Asynchronous socket support has not been tested.</P>

<P> The Socket interface uses <i>mbufs</i> to implement a zero-copy
send and receive interface.  Outgoing data is transferred immediately
to the socket layer without touching that user provided data.  </P>

<H2>Internet initialization and utilities (In)</H2>

<P>Since we borrow some low-level components of the Unix networking
source, it is necessary to spoof various components into believing
that it is running in the context of Digital Unix.  </P>

<P>The <i>In</i> module defines the in_aliasreq and in_ifaddr data
structures used to register interface devices (lance, t3, etc.).  For
each IP address assigned to an interface, an in_ifaddr structure is
allocated and added to the interface address list.  IP addresses are
assigned using the In.Control() procedure define in the 
<A HREF="../urtcore/src/In.i3">In</A> interface.</P

<H2>TCP from Digital Unix V3.2</H2>

<A HREF="../../net/doc/index.html">Plexus</A> supports multiple
implementations of the same protocol for different endpoints in the
same way that it supports multiple protocols -- different handlers are
fired in response to different guard predicates evaluating true.

We currently borrow the TCP protocol from Digital Unix.  To make TCP
work in our environment required that we import other networking
modules found in the netinet directory.  In particular the following
modules are required: <P> 

<DL>

<DT> <tt> Internet support (in.c)</tt>. Initializes the internet
support and provide utility functions. <P>

<DT> <tt> Protocol control block (in_pcb.c)</tt>. <P>

<DT> <tt> Berkeley Socket support (uipc_socket.c and uipc_socket2.c)</tt>. <P>

<DT> <tt> Berkeley memory buffer (uipc_mbuf.c)</tt>. <P>

<DT> <tt> TCP input processing (tcp_input.c)</tt>. <P>

<DT> <tt> TCP output processing (tcp_output.c)</tt>. <P>

<DT> <tt> Miscellaneous TCP support routines (tcp_subr.c)</tt>. <P>

<DT> <tt> Functions for slow/fast TCP timeouts (tcp_timer.c)</tt>. <P>

<DT> <tt> TCP debugging and tracing utiDTties (tcp_debug.c)</tt>. <P>

<DT> <tt> Berkeley protocol software table (tcp_usrreq.c)</tt>. Used
to glue socket operations with protocol operations. <P>

</DL>

<em>URT</em> defines a OsfNet module that initializes the TCP module,
starts the fast and slow TCP timers, initializes a protocol software
table (protosw) and unix domain structure for TCP, implements the
pffindtype() function to return the protosw structure, and provides
the interface to call TCP's input routine.  In relation to the Plexus
osfClient, OsfNet does the top-level initialization of internal
datastructures, whereas the osfClient passes packets to the Digital
Unix networking code.

Rather than littering the networking C code with <em>SPIN</em>
specific #ifdef statements, <em>URT</em>'s net_upcall modules defines
the C functions and globals used by the networking code.  The
net_upcalls module provides upcalls (via procedure variables), and
global variables and dummy functions that are used to spoof the
networking tcp C code to believe it is running in a environment.

There are a few functions that the networking code calls that are
redirected to a <em>Modula-3</em> implementation provided by
<em>URT</em>.  The redirection is achieved via procedure variables
that are bound to the <em>Modula-3</em> implementation at <em>URT</em>
initialization.  The following procedures are currently redirected:

<DL>

<DT> <tt> ip_output()</tt>.  Redirected to the IP output function
provided by <em>Plexus</em>.  <P>

<DT> <tt> pffindtype ()</tt>. Redirected to OsfNet provided by
<em>URT</em>.  <P>

</DL>

<H3>Network Synchronization and Socket Locking</H3>

The networking code (tcp and sockets) use reader/writer lock
primitives for synchronization.  Specifically, TCP time out functions,
TCP input and output processing, and all accesses to protocol control
blocks (pcb) and sockets are synchronized using locks.  These locks
are used when setting the #define NETSYNC_LOCK to TRUE in
net/net_globals.h.  The lock primitives (ulock_xxx ops) are emulated
by <em>SPIN</em> and are implemented by 
<A HREF="../../../kernel/spincore/src/machine/ALPHA_SPIN/sal/ThreadForSAL.i3">ThreadForSAL</A>
<P>

The <em>net_upcalls.c</em> file defines the following functions and
global variables related to synchronization:

<DL>

<DT> solock() and sounlock() call solock_ext() and sounlock_ext(),
respectively, and are called to synchronize on socket operations.

<DT> route_lock, inifaddr_lock, igmp_lock and inp_udp_li are global
lock data structures that are initialized explicitly by the OsfNet
module.

<DT> lockmode is set to the preemptive kernel lock mode.  (lockmode=1)

</DL>

<H3>Global Variables</H3>

The following global variables are linked by the networking C code:

<DL>

<DT> <tt> struct in_ifaddr *in_ifaddr;</tt> is the head of the
in_ifaddr structure list, which is used by the in.c module.  <P>

<DT> <tt> unsigned char inetctlerrmap[24];</tt> is defined but not
used.  <P>

<DT> <tt> struct protosw inetsw[1]</tt>; is previously used by the
pffindtype() function, which is now implemented by the OsfNet module.
<P>

<DT> <tt> struct ifqueue ipintrq;</tt> must be defined, but is not used.

<DT> <tt> struct ifnet loif;</tt> must be defined, but is not used.

</DL>

<H3>Dummy Functions</H3>
<P>
The  networking code is functional without various support
functions.  The following list of dummy functions either do nothing or
return a default value (typically 0 or 1).
<P>
<UL><LI> ip_ctloutput 
<LI> ip_srcroute
<LI> iptime
<LI> ip_stripoptions
<LI> ip_freemoptions
<LI> sockaddr_old 
<LI> arpaliaswhohas
<LI> if_addmulti 
<LI> if_delmulti 
<LI> ifa_ifwithaddr 
<LI> ifa_ifwithdstaddr 
<LI> igmp_joingroup 
<LI> igmp_leavegroup 
<LI> rtinit 
<LI> rtrequest  
<LI> rt_missmsg 
<LI> rtalloc 
<LI> rtfree 
<LI> gsignal
<LI> pfind
<LI> psignal_inthread
<LI> P_UNREF
<LI> uiomove
</UL>
<P>

Many of the above functions are used to optimize the packet processing
path through the networking code.  The <em>inaction</em> of these
functions simply forces the networking code to follow a more general
and slower path.
