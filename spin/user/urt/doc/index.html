<H1> URT: Unix Runtime Support</H1>

<em>SPIN</em> borrows code from Digitial Unix V3.2 that implements
device management, Berkeley memory buffers, sockets and support for
TCP.  This code is very low-level and not designed to be used by
untrusted extensions, and exporting direct access to these services
may enable extensions to subvert system integrity.  
<em>URT</em> is a trusted system extension that bridges the gap
between untrusted system and the borrowed unix code.  <em>URT</em>
defines <em>Modula-3</em> types for kernel data structures (such as
mbufs, uio, socket, etc.), and interfaces to existing Unix services.
Presently, <em>URT</em> is designed to work with a Digital Unix V3.2
based <a href="../../../kernel/sal/doc/index.html">SAL</a>.

URT is currently split into two subsystems that can be linked
separately.  <A HREF="urtcore.html">URT core</A> provides a set of
basic interfaces, whereas <A HREF="urtnet.html">URT net</A> provides
services that are specific to the networking code found in Digital
Unix V3.2.
