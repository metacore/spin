(* HISTORY
 * 31-May-97  David Becker at the University of Washington
 *      Replace ifp net interface with NetDev objects
 *	Deleted ifnet type
 *
 * 19-Oct-96  Marc Fiuczynski (mef) at the University of Washington
 *	Updated to be SAL independent.
 *
 * 11-Jun-96 oystr at the University of Washington
 *	Added ifconf struct.
 *
 * 08-Feb-96  Charles Garrett (garrett) at the University of Washington
 *	Add SetNetOutput function which permits the unsafe interface
 *	IfExtern to be hidden rather than visible.
 *
 * 11-Sep-95  Marc Fiuczynski (mef) at the University of Washington
 *	This interface assumes that the following #defines are true in sys/if.h
 *		_KERNEL = TRUE
 *		NETSYNCLOCK = TRUE
 *		LOCK_NETSTATS = TRUE
 *       which are defined based on other #defines (_KERNEL) in Makefile
 *       and (UNIX_LOCKS) unix_locks.h.
 *	
 * 10-Sep-95  Marc Fiuczynski (mef) at the University of Washington
 *	This interface is a close representation of net/if.h.
 *	Due to interfacing with C code, this interface does not define
 *	fields of unix structs using traced references.
 *
 * 07-Sep-95  Marc Fiuczynski (mef) at the University of Washington
 *	Created to be compatible with net/if.h in Unix.
 *
