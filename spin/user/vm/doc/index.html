<p>SPIN manages three kinds of memory, traced heap, untraced heap and
user virtual memory. The traced heap and untraced heap are used by
spincore and in-kernel extensions. (the difference between traced heap
and untraced heap is that the former is garbage collected, but the
latter is not. The traced heap is used by Modula-3 codes, and the
untraced heap is used primarily by C codes). User virtual memory is
used by user space applications, but it may be used by extensions
to store bulk data, eg, by the file cache manager.  This section describes
the management of user virtual memory. Ask other people(i.e., Pardy)
about the traced and the untraced heaps.

<p>User virtual memory is managed by the cooperation of
<a href="../../../kernel/spincore/src/memory/doc/index.html">Spincore</a> and
several extensions, including
<a
href="../vmcore/doc/index.html">vmcore</a>.

<p>Spincore manages two types of objects, <code>PhysAddr.T</code> and
<code>Translation.T</code>. They are abstractions for a page frame and
an address space(pmap), respectively.  Spincore supports allocation
and deallocation of PhysAddr.Ts, and mapping and unmapping of
PhysAddr.Ts onto Translation.Ts.

<p>The
<a href="../vmcore/doc/index.html">vmcore</a>
extension provides <code>MemoryObject.T</code>, the memory
object abstraction similar(but not same) to that provided by Mach.

<p>There are two other extensions that subtype
<code>MemoryObject.T</code> to provide some standard memory management
facilities.  The <a href="../filepager/doc/index.html">default
pager</a> extension implements a subtype of
<code>MemoryObject.T</code> that swaps pages to disks. The <a
href="../inodepager/doc/InodePager.html">inode pager</a> extension caches
file contents on memory objects.
