<h2>VMcore</h2>

VM extension is built on top of <a
href="../../../../kernel/spincore/src/memory/doc/index.html">the
spincore VM </a> to provide more user friendly services.

<p> Two objects <em>AddressSpace.T</em> and <em>MemoryObject.T</em>
play role in the VMcore extension.

<h3>AddressSpace object</h3>

<p>
A virtual address space is represented by the
<a href="../src/AddressSpace.i3">AddressSpace.T</a> object.
<code>AddressSpace.T</code> is a subtype of
<a href="../../../../kernel/spincore/src/memory/doc/Translation.html">
Translation.T</a> which is defined in the spincore.
It allows for mapping and unmapping of memory objects, which are described
below.


<blockquote>
<strong>Note:</strong>
<code>AddressSpace.T</code> is further subtyped into
<a href="../src/AddressSpace.i3"><em>Space.T</em></a>.
In addition to all the functions of AddressSpace.T, Space.T provides
easy-to-use memory allocation and deallocation routines.
We plan to phase out Space.T soon. 
It now exists mainly for the backward compatibility reason.
</blockquote>

<h3>Memory Object</h3>

<p> <a href="../src/MemoryObject.i3">MemoryObject.T</a> is a container
of physical page frames. Memory cannot be allocated on an address
space directly; it first has to be allocated on a memory object, and
then the memory object is mapped on the address space.  A memory
object can be mapped on more than one address spaces(or more than one
virtual address regions on a single address space). Thus, memory
object serves as a unit of memory sharing.

<h4>Internal structure of memory object</h4>

<p> Internally, a memory object consists of two objects, <a
href="../src/CacheObject.i3">cache</a> and <a
href="../src/PagerObject.i3">pager</a>.  Cache holds a set of page
frames. All the frames owned by a memory object is stored in the cache
object.

<p> Pager implements a mechanism to transfer pages to and from memory
and an external I/O device(disk, network, etc).

<h4>Varieties of Pagers</h4>

Pager is expected to be subtyped. Currently, two types of pagers are
provided, <em>Bogopager</em> and <em>Filepager</em>.

<ul>
  <li> Bogopager always provides a zero filled page on page fault.
       It doesn't provide the page out operation.
       Bogopager comes with the vmcore extension.
  <li> Filepager provides a zero filled page on the first fault.
       It supports page-out on generic
       <a href="../../../fs/doc/index.html">file system</a>.
       When loaded into memory, the default pager replaces the
       <a href="../src/DefaultPager.i3">public procedures</a>
       to call bogopager using the
       <!--href="dispatcher">event</a> mechanism.
       Thus, the bogopager and the default pager
       are used in the same way.
</ul>

<blockquote>
<strong>Note: </strong>
The reason the bogopager is there is that the file pager depends on
the file system, and file system depends on vmcore. Therefore, we
can't put the default pager in vmcore, or we have circular dependency.
</blockquote>

<h4>Memory Object Methods</h4>

<code>MemoryObject.T</code> exports two methods <code>pageIn</code>
and <code>pageOut</code>. Although the object provides default
implementations that looks up the cache and the pager(described
above), you are also welcome to subtype the object and override these
procedures (in that case, cache and pager will become dormant).

<h2>To-do list</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Addressmap iteration is not mutexed. 
  <li> Implement memory object expansion / contraction.
  <li> Make ExternRef an extension. There is nothing privileged about
       this service.
  <li> Delete external ref crap in Space.
  <li> Delete <code>Space</code> altogether. I see no strong reason why
       <code>Space</code> and <code>AddressSpace</code> has to be
       separate.
  <li> Reconsider the vm design, especially the role separation
       between cache and pager.
  <li> Burst paging(how?) and asynchronous read ahead(how?)
</ul>
