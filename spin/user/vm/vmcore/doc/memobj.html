<h2>Memory Object</h2>

Memory object is a conainer of page frames.

<p>
Internally, a memory object consists of two objects,
<a href="../src/CacheObject.i3">cache</a> and
<a href="../src/PagerObject.i3">pager</a>.
Cache holds a set of page frames. All the frames
in a memory object is recorded in the cache object.

<p>
Pager implements a mechanism to read and write pages to and from
memory and external I/O device. Pager is expected to be
subtyped. Currently, two types of pagers are provided,
Default default pager(aka <dfn>bogopager</dfn>)
and <a href="../../filepager/doc/FilePager.html">Real default pager</a>(aka <dfn>default
pager</dfn>).

<ul>
  <li> Bogopager always provides a zero filled page on page fault.
       It doesn't provide the page out operation.
       Bogopager comes with the vmcore extension.
  <li> Default pager provides a zero filled page on first fault.
       It supports page-out on generic
       <a href="../../../fs/doc/index.html">file system</a>.
       When loaded into memory, the default pager replaces the
       <a href="../src/DefaultPager.i3">public procedures</a>
       to call bogopager. Thus, the bogopager and the default pager
       are used in the same way.
</ul>

<blockquote>
The reason the bogopager is there is that the default pager depends on
the file system, and file system depends on vmcore. Therefore, we
can't put the default pager in vmcore, or we have circular dependency.

<h2>Pager Interface</h2>

Here is the list of mechods that all <a href="../src/PagerObject.i3">
pagers</a> have to provide.

<dl>
  <dt> <b>init(): T;</b>
  <dt> <b>destroy()</b>
  <dt> <b>pageIn(offset: PageNumber; VAR data : ARRAY OF CHAR) : ResultCode;
       </b>
  <dd> Read the contents of the page <var>offset</var> from the external
       device. The <a href="../src/PagerObject.i3">
       <code>ResultCode</code></a> is an enumerated type
       whose values include the following.

       <p>
       <dl>
	 <dt> Success
	 <dd> This is the normal return code.
	 <dt> AlreadyPagedIn
	 <dd> This indicates that the requested page to
	      should be in memory already. When this code is
	      returned, the memory object rechecks the cache object.
	 <dt> AlreadyPagedOut
	 <dd> This code should be returned only by <code>pageOut</code>
	      method described below. This code indicates that the
	      requested page is already paged out. When the memory
	      object gets this code, it interprets as
	      <em>Success</em>.
	 <dt> DeviceFull
	 <dt> NotImplemented
	 <dd> These are catastrophic event.
	      The memory object is immediately destroyed.
	      (not done now)
       </dl>
  <dt> <b>pageOut(offset : PageNumber; READONLY data : ARRAY OF CHAR;
	    dirty: BOOLEAN) : ResultCode;</b>
  <dd> Write the page out to the external device.
       
</dl>
