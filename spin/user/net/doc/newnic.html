<P>
There are three things necessary to support a new network interface
card:
<P>
<OL><LI> <tt> Ephemeral packet Arrived function.</tt> The device driver will
  call this function in the context of an interrupt handler.  The
  purpose of this function is to either raise the linker layer
  PacketArrived event, or kick a thread that will raise that event for
  each packet delivered by the device driver.
<P>
<LI> <tt> Output function.</tt> A link layer output function that calls
  the device driver to send a packet.
<P>
<LI> <tt> if_attach</tt>.  network interface cards register
  themselves with a call to if_attach.  This is then reflected via
  <em> URT
 </em>'s IfPrivate module and should eventually end up in the
  <em> SPIN
 </em>'s device management.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
NEED TO SHOW EXAMPLES AND CODE.
