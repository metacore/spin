<H1>Creating A New Protocol</H1>
<P>

Creating a new protocol in plexus is simple.  The first step is to
define the protocol's header in an interface file.  Plexus follows the
naming convention of <i>protocol</i>PktFormat.i3 for each protocol.
This interface file describes the header layout of the protocol as a
<em>Modula-3</em> RECORD and any other constants used by the protocol.
The RECORD must be <i>packed</i> to prevent the compiler from padding
it.  Following the Modula-3 naming convetion, the
<i>protocol</i>PktFormat.T type defines the protocol's header type.
For example, the interface for the Ethernet protocol looks like:

<pre>
INTERFACE EtherPktFormat;
TYPE EtherType = BITS 16 FOR [16_0 .. 16_ffff];
TYPE T = RECORD
  dhost   : ARRAY [1..6] OF CHAR;
  shost   : ARRAY [1..6] OF CHAR;
  type    : EtherType;
END;

CONST
  ETHERTYPE_IP  : EtherType= 16_0800; (* IP protocol number        *)
  ETHERTYPE_ARP : EtherType= 16_0806; (* Addr. resolution protocol *)

END EtherPktFormat;
</pre>

The next step is to define the protocol events. All Plexus protocols
define a <tt>PacketArrived</tt> event. This event roughly corresponds
to the <tt>input</tt> function found in BSD style protocol stacks, and
serves as the binding points for extending a protocol with customized
a implementation.  The Modula-3 type signature of the PacketArrived
event is:

<pre>
TYPE PacketArrivedEvent = PROCEDURE (packet, curr: Mbuf.T; offset: CARDINAL):BOOLEAN;
</pre>

By convention this event is defined in a <i>protocol</i>.i3 interface
file. Packet data is passed up and down protocol layers using the <A
HREF="../../urt/doc/index.html#mbuf">mbuf</A> datastructure.  Plexus
mbufs are similar to the Berkeley memory buffers found in conventional
Unix operating systems.  This datastructure is used more as a matter
of convince, as it works directly with the device drivers that are
using in SPIN. The <code>packet</code> parameter is an mbuf pointer to
the beginning of a packet chain.  The <code>curr</code> parameter is a
pointer to the mbuf that contains the packet payload.  It is very
likely that for low-layered protocols both <code>packet</code> and
<code>curr</code> point at the same mbuf.  However, for high-layer
protocols, such as Udp and Tcp, the header and data may not be
contained in the initial mbuf.  The <code>curr</code> mbuf pointer
prevents us from having to walk the linked list of the mbuf chain to
find the payload that is currently being processed.  <P>

To make life easier, there is a quake directive, called
<code>protocolModule</code>, that instantiates a generic 
<A HREF="../plexus/src/Protocol.ig">interface</A> and 
<A HREF="../plexus/src/Protocol.mg">module</A>.  The generic defines the
<tt>PacketArrived</tt> event and (un)install procedures used by
clients that attach themselves to the event.

The directive comes in the conventional m3build forms, where the lower
case version hides the module and the upper case version allows other
modules to link/import with the interface.  Here's an example of the
<code>Ether</code> protocol begin instantiated with the m3build
directive:

<pre> 
ProtocolModule ("Ether","EtherServer") # visible
protocolmodule ("Ether","EtherServer") # hidden
</pre>

Note the different cases of the visible and hidden
<i>protocolmodule</i> directives.  The first argument to the directive
is the name of the protocol.  The second argument is the domain name
that the protocol is defined in.  The <code>protocolmodule</code> is
just a bit of glue for the following quake commands:

<pre>
proc ProtocolModule (protocol,link) is
  local inf   = link & "Interface"
  build_generic_intf (protocol, "Protocol", [], VISIBLE)
  build_generic_impl (protocol, "Protocol", [inf])
end
</pre>
