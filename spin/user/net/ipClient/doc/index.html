<H2>IP</H2>

The IPClassification module raises the Udp, Tcp, and Icmp
PacketArrived events for their corresponding packets.  The IPFrag
module currently handles all of the reassembling of UDP and TCP
packets.  It should probably be generalized to just re-raise the
Ip.PacketArrived event after reassembling an ip packet.  Finally, the
IpGen module sends ip packets using a route from the IpRoute module.
IpGen will fragment packets based on the MTU of the outgoing device.

<H2>IP Reassembly Notes</H2>

The IpFrag module reassembles incoming IP fragments.  It shallow
copies fragments into new mbufs, and then puts these new mbufs into a
sorted list.  When all the fragments have arrived the mbufs are
chained together to create the reassembled datagram.  A generic hash
table is used to hold the linked lists, and non-reassembled fragments
are flushed from the table after 30 seconds.

<H3>Problems and Bugs</H3>

<DL>
<DT> SIZE
<DD>There are some disadvantages the current implementation,
notably the open-ended size of the hash table.  While this is good in
some respects, as you never have to drop a packet because you ran out
of room, its disadvantage is that an unlimited number of outstanding
packets can take quite a bit of memory to buffer.  This is a problem
if the system is attacked with a flood of many large datagrams.  A
good solution to this problem would be to set a high and low water
mark.  When the amount of data in buffered packets reaches the high
water mark, the buffer space is pruned back down to the low water
mark.

<DT>MBUF WEIRDNESS
<DD>One possible bug with the code is involved with mbuf weirdness.
The first mbuf of the first packet (packets can come in as multiple
chained mbufs) needs to be a packet header type mbuf.  If it isn't, I
create an mbuf that is, and prepend it to the front of the chain.
Unfortunately, the mbuf code doesn't like an mbuf with no data of its
own.  The first mbuf of the first packet <EM>should</EM> always be of
the packet header type, so this isn't causing problems now.

<DT>ICMP reassembly timeout
<DD> Another lacking is that no ICMP reassembly timeout messages are
sent back when the reassembly of a datagram times out.</P>

<H3>Design decisions</H3>

<P> Packets are timed out using the Clock.SetAlarm procedure which is
called every 30 seconds if there are any non-reassembled packets in
the hash table.  If the table is empty, there will be no alarm set.</P>
