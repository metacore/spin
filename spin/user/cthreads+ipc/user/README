This directory contains a worked example of dynamically linking safe
M3 code into the kernel.  The convert script takes the M3 .io and .mo
files and generates a C file with a huge char array containing the
COFF format object files.  The data generated by the convert script is
then download(ed) and drop(ed) into the kernel, where its COFF format
is digested by the SPIN dynlink modules.  The downloaded M3 files are
then initialized, which invokes the main body of the M3 module.  The
code in the main body installs event handlers that can be accessed via
TRAP (syscalls) from user level.  

See the README in ../src for further information.
